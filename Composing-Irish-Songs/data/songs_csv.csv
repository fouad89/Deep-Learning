hey diddle diddle the cat took a piddle all over the kitchen floor
the little dog laughed to see such sport...so the cat did a little bit more 
jack and jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water
jill came down with half a crown... it wasn't for carrying water 
georgy porgy puddin' and pie kissed the girls and made them cry
when the boys came out to play...he kissed them too he's funny that way 
little miss muffet sat on her tuffet her knickers all tattered and torn
it wasn't the spider that sat down beside her...but little boy blue with his horn 
jack be nimble jack be quick, jack jumped over the candlestick
goodness gracious he should've jumped higher..goodness gracious great ball of fire 
there once was a man named hardcastle from a billiard ball was struck
and on his tomb was written...hardcastle... hardball...hardluck 
there once was a nun named vera and she wouldn't let any man near her
a crafty old monk slipped into her bunk...now she's a mother superior "
A Beer With No Pub,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=585,"in two thousand twenty
few things were funny
st. patrick was kicked to the curb
complete sterilization
replaced socialization
in every city and burb
no one supposed
pubs and restaurants closed
times have rarely been worse
you could hear people moan
i must drink on my own
when quelling a powerful thirst
but there in the lonely quiet
in every saloon pub or bar
slowing dying with time
is fresh beer in the lines
never reaching a 16ounce jar
no bartender tips
no foam on the lips
no conversation or cheer
live music is canned
at least youtubes not banned
and hoarders havent targeted beer
my waistline is thinning
i dont feel like im winning
im missing the  solid pub grub
my tears are not average
as i think of the beverage
a lonely beer with no pub"
A Fenian Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=4,"the queen's own regiment was their name
from fair toronto town they came
to put the irish all to shame
the queen's and colonel boker
what fury fills each loyal mind?
no volunteer would stay behind
they flung their red rag to the wind
""hurrah, my boys!"" said boker
now helter skelter ohio
see how they play that ""heel and toe""
see how they run from their irish foe
the queen's and colonel boker!"
A Letter from Jesse,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=5,"mr. whitford,
yesterday was truly a tragedy for our country. and after all of that i am so pleased to be alive today. our country is strong and i believe we will all get through this. last night i was cleaning my room, and i just stopped and thought of how many people will never clean their room, sit in their room, or see their room again. for the first time in my life i was happy to be cleaning my room because i was just alive. so many people lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters. yet, here i am safe and sound with my family, friends, teachers, and loved ones so close. i am amazingly grateful for all i have always had.
i wanted to tell you that i am thankful for everything you have given me and, how much you have taught me. you showed me by example to be kind and generous to all those in need. each day i walk in the doors of this school and see everyone around me as a gift. i feel this inside but, now i am letting you all know that this is the way i feel towards everything you do. just being here gives us something to look forward to each day. you are my extended family and if you were gone i would feel so much sorrow.
we all have our memories or years, months, weeks, days, and minutes ago but, we have something that all innocent victims of this tragedy do not. we all have a future! you are all in my near and far future and my past. once again i thank you for just showing me the way when i needed it, and just being there. what greater gift is there to fall asleep and just wake up and see the world again.
love,
jesse

A Little Bit of Heaven,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=1,"sure a little bit of  heaven fell from out the sky one day
and it nestled in the ocean in a place so far away
and when the angels found it sure it looked so sweet and fair
they said suppose we leave it for it lookes so peaceful there
so they sprinkled it with stardust just to make the shamorcks grow
it's the only place you'll find them no matter where you go
then they darted it with silver just to make the lakes look grand
and when they had it finsihed sure they called it ireland"

A Man's a Man for A' That,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=566,"is there for honest poverty
that hings his head, an' a' that;
the coward slave - we pass him by,
we dare be poor for a' that!
for a' that, an' a' that.
our toils obscure an' a' that,
the rank is but the guinea's stamp,
the man's the gowd for a' that.
what though on hamely fare we dine,
wear hodden grey, an' a that;
gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;
a man's a man for a' that:
for a' that, and a' that,
their tinsel show, an' a' that;
the honest man, tho' e'er sae poor,
is king o' men for a' that.
ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord,
wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that;
tho' hundreds worship at his word,
he's but a coof for a' that:
for a' that, an' a' that,
his ribband, star, an' a' that:
the man o' independent mind
he looks an' laughs at a' that.
a prince can mak a belted knight,
a marquis, duke, an' a' that;
but an honest man's abon his might,
gude faith, he maunna fa' that!
for a' that, an' a' that,
their dignities an' a' that;
the pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth,
are higher rank than a' that.
then let us pray that come it may,
(as come it will for a' that,)
that sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,
shall bear the gree, an' a' that.
for a' that, an' a' that,
it's coming yet for a' that,
that man to man, the world o'er,
shall brothers be for a' that."
A Mother's Love is a Blessing,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=8,"an irish boy was leaving
leaving his native home,
crossing the broad atlantic,
once more he wished to roam,
and as he was leaving his mother,
while standing on the quay,
he threw his arms around her waist
and this to her did say:
and as the years grow onward,
i'll settle down in life,
and i'll choose a nice young colleen,
and take her for my wife.
and as the kids grow older,
they'll play around my knee
and i'll teach them the very same lesson
that my mother taught to me:
a mother's love is a blessing,
no matter where you roam.
keep her while she's living,
you'll miss her when she's gone.
love her as in childhood,
when feeble, old and grey,
for you'll never miss a mother's love
'til she's buried beneath the clay."
A Nation Once Again,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=9,"when boyhood's fire was in my blood
i read of ancient freemen
when greece and rome who bravely stood
three hundred men and three men
and then i prayed i might yet see
our fetters rent in twain
and ireland long a province be
a nation once again
a nation once again,a nation once again
and ireland long a province be a nation once again
and from that time through wildest woe
that hope has shone a far light
nor could love's brightest glow
outshine that solemn starlight
it seemed to watch above my head in forum field and fane
it's angels voice sang 'round my bed
a nation once again   
it whispered too that freedon's ark
and service high and holy
would be profane by feeling dark
for passions vane or lowly
but freedom comes from god's right hand
and needs a godly train
and rightous men must make our land
a nation once again  
so as i grew from boy to man
i bent me to that bidding
my spirit of each selfish plan
and cruel passion ridding
for thus, i hoped one day to aid
oh can such hope be vain?
when my dear country shall be made
a nation once again   "
A Pair of Brown Eyes,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=10,"one summer evening drunk to hell
i sat there nearly lifeless
and old man in the corner sang
where the water lilies grow
and on the jukebox johnny sang about a thing called love                                                                 and it's how you are kid and what's your name
and how would you bloody know
in blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
i lay down on the ground
and the arms and legs of other men were scattered all around                                                         some cursed some prayed, some prayed then cursed                                                                      they prayed then bled some more
and the only thing that i could see
was a pair of brown eyes
that was looking at me
but when we got back labelled parts one to three                                                                                        there was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
and a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go for a pair of brown eyes
i looked at him he looked at me all i could do was hate him                                                        while ray and philomena sang of my elusive dreams                                                                            i saw the streams the rolling hills
where his brown eyes were waiting
and i thought about a pair of brown eyes
that waited once for me
so drunk to hell i left the place
sometimes crawling sometimes walking
a hungry sound came across the breeze
so i gave the walls a talking
and i heard the sounds of long ago from the old canal                                                                  and the birds were whistling in the trees                                                                             where the wind was gently laughing"
A Rainy Night in Soho,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=11,"i've been loving you a long time
down all the years
down all the days
and i've cried for all your troubles                                                                 smiled at your funny little ways                                                                                                       we watched our friends grow up together                                                                                     and we saw them as they fell                                                                                                 some of them fell into heaven ,
some of them fell into hell
i took shelter from a shower
and i stepped into your arms
on a rainy night in soho
the wind was whistling all its charms
i sang you all my sorrows
you told me all your joys                                                                  whatever happened to that old song
to all those little girls and boys
now the song is nearly over
we may never find out what it means                                                     but there's a light i hold before me
and you're the measure of my dreams
the measure of my dreams
sometimes i wake up in the morning
the gingerlady by my bed
covered in a cloak of silence
i hear you in my head                                                                              i'm not singing for the future
i'm not dreaming of the past                                                                 i'm not talking of the first time
i never think about the last
now the song is nearly over
we may never find out what it means                                                     still there's a light i hold before me

A Song for Harry  O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=12,"i saw a young family
just the other day
and they reminded me of a promise
that i made
that i would never live those words
that harry sang so free
little boy blue and silver spoons
would all be part of me
first steps, first words
would be just that
they'd all come first to me
if the bough should break
i would ease the fall
of broken hearts and wounded knees
well, we became pretty goods friends
as the years they rolled along
i came to like his friends
and even tolerate his songs
i helped him with his homework
till the subjects grew too hard
i saw him off to his senior prom
as they drove off in my car
than it came so quickly
as the days turned into years
how being there for nightmare fears
turned into grown up tears
it's said we're here on borrowed time
that much i know is true
the day will come when we find our way
there's no exception to that rule
he found his way one quiet day
and he's left me here behind
and memories of shoulder rides are frozen still in time
so harry i thank you
for the song you sang
you helped me raise my son
but i don't regret a single day
as you both watch us from above
first steps, first words
were all just that
they all came first with me
when the bough came down
i eased the fall
of broken hearts and wounded knees"
A Wedding Song O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=13,"look into my eyes
tell me what you see
tell me how the years
can pass so easily
do you see the past
or what my life can be
look into my eyes
and tell me what you see
for now it is time to fly
as i reach for the sky
i'll soar to reach the sun
as my new life has begun
look into my heart
as my journey lies ahead
i know you wish me well
as some things are left unsaid
today begins anew
and not a tear we'll shed
look into my heart as my journey lies ahead"
After All These Years,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=14,"my darling come to me, set you down easily
and rest awhile by the soft firelight...cold is the night
but warm is my heart with pride
having you by my side
you're still my guiding light after all these years
your soft assuring ways, the rock i lean on
saw me through my darkest days
when all hope had gone
you're still the only one, i'll ever hold near
and i love you, after all these years
time from me passes on, and i'm growing old
a lifetime nearly gone, i cannot unfold...nights dark and cold
but warm is your hand in mine, feeble with ageless time
the light of love still shine after all these years   "
After the Time,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=15,"i woke up this mornin' arse up on the floor
i opened one eye there were beer cans galore
my head how it pounded my poor body shook
and i nearly got sick when i got up to look
at the wholes in the canvass the stains on the bed
there wasn't a window where one should be at
there was beer in the dish that was left for the cat
but oh what a wonderful time
so you grab the dustpan and i'll grab the mop
you clean the bottom and i'll clean the top
we'll break out the lestoil and tear up some rags
to clean up after the time
i went to the kitchen to grab me a drink
there were glasses all rotten piled up in the sink
and half bowls of 'moo soup' all strewn 'round the place
and half eated cold place took up all the space
there was unopened home brew still left from the tear
three odd pairs of shoes and some strange underwear
and my cousin still smokin' asleep in the chair
but oh! what a wonderful time   
i went to the bathroom to grab me a scrub
we were all out of arse wipes there was beer in the tub
the toilet was plugged up and filled to the brim
and the bluebottle flies were lined up for a swim
the mirror was broken the shower curtain tore
i don't think it was water what wetted the floor
and some impatient knocker left holes in the door
but oh! what a wonderful time"

Angel of Hope O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=19,"take me on your wing
together we will fly
let me see your memory thru the teardrop in my eye
lift my spirit high
till i can touch your soul
take me on your wing
with all the love i bring
my sweet angel of hope
i search for you each moment
and wonder where you are
on summer winds and butterflies
i've searched from near and far
but i know you're here to comfort me
till i can find my way
and although you speak in silence
try to hear what you still say
when a springtime sky
that's full of clouds
reveals a patch of blue
and a warming sun comes shining thru
i know that can be you 
this life is full of happenings
that we don't understand
still you are my miracle
blessed by god's own hand
and my miracle will be complete
and i'll be truly blessed
when i wrap my arms around you
and hold you close against my breast
now we have a place for us
that we can call our own
as i gaze upon your smiling face
sweet angel of hope    "
Armed Forces Lyrics,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=507,"marine's hymn
from the halls of montezuma
to the shores of tripoli
we fight our country's battles
in the air, on land, and sea;
first to fight for right and freedom
and to keep our honor clean;
we are proud to claim the title
of united states marine.
our flag's unfurled to every breeze
from dawn to setting sun;
we have fought in every clime and place
where we could take a gun.
in the snow of far-off northern lands
and in sunny tropic scenes;
you will find us always on the job --
the united states marines.
here's health to you and to our corps
which we are proud to serve;
in many a strife we've fought for life
and never lost our nerve.
if the army and the navy
ever look on heaven's scenes,
they will find the streets are guarded
by united states marines.
the army song
first to fight for the right,
and to build the nations might,
and the army goes rolling along
proud of all we have done,
fighting till the battles won,
and the army goes rolling along.
 then its hi! hi! hey!
the armys on its way.
count off the cadence loud and strong
(two! three!)
for where eer we go,
you will always know
that the army goes rolling along.
valley forge, custers ranks,
san juan hill and pattons tanks,
and the army went rolling along
minute men, from the start,
always fighting from the heart,
and the army keeps rolling along.
men in rags, men who froze,
still that army met its foes,
and the army went rolling along.
faith in god, then were right,
and well fight with all our might,
as the army keeps rolling along. 
anchors aweigh
stand navy out to sea, fight our battle cry; we'll never change our course,
so vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.
roll out the tnt, anchors aweigh.
sail on to victory
and sink their bones to davy jones, hooray!
anchors away, my boys, anchors aweigh.
farewell to foreign shores,
we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.
through our last night on shore,
drink to the foam,
until we meet once more.
here's wishing you a happy voyage home.
blue of the mighty deep; gold of god's sun
let these colors be till all of time
be done, done, done,
on seven seas we learn navy's stern call:
faith, courage, service true,
with honor, over honor, over all.
off we go into the wild blue yonder
off we go into the wild blue yonder,
climbing high into the sun;
here they come zooming to meet our thunder, at 'em boys, give 'er the gun!
(give 'er the gun now!)
down we dive, spouting our flame from under,
off with one helluva roar!
we live in fame or go down in flame. hey! nothing'll stop the u.s. air force!
additional verses:
minds of men fashioned a crate of thunder,
sent it high into the blue;
hands of men blasted the world asunder;
how they lived god only knew!
(god only knew then!)
souls of men dreaming of skies to conquer
gave us wings, ever to soar!
with scouts before and bombers galore. hey! nothing'll stop the u.s. air force!
bridge: 'a toast to the host'
here's a toast to the host
of those who love the vastness of the sky,
to a friend we send a message
of his brother men who fly.
we drink to those
who gave their all of old,
then down we roar
to score the rainbow's pot of gold.
a toast to the host of men we boast,
the u.s. air force! zoom!
off we go into the wild sky yonder, keep the wings level and true;
if you'd live to be a grey-haired wonder
keep the nose out of the blue!
(out of the blue, boy!)
flying men, guarding the nation's border,
we'll be there, followed by more!
in echelon we carry on. hey!
nothing'll stop the u.s. air force!
semper paratus (always ready)
the united states coast guard theme song
from north and south and east and west,
the coast guard's in the fight.
destroying subs and landing troops,
the axis feels our might.
for we're the first invaders,
on every fighting field.
afloat, ashore, on men and spars,
you'll find the coast guard shield.
we're always ready for the call,
we place our trust in thee.
through howling gale and shot and shell,
to win our victory.
'semper paratus' is our guide,
our pledge, our motto, too.
we're 'always ready,' do or die!
aye! coast guard, we fight for you.
from aztec shore to arctic zone,
to europe and far east.
the flag is carried by our ships,
in times of war and peace.
and never have we struck it yet,
in spite of foe-men's might,
who cheered our crews and cheered again,
for showing how to fight.
we're always ready for the call,
we place our trust in thee.
through howling gale and shot and shell,
to win our victory.
'semper paratus' is our guide,
our pledge, our motto, too.
we're 'always ready,' do or die! aye!
coast guard, we fight for you.
surveyor and narcissus,
the eagle and dispatch,
the hudson and the tampa
the names are hard to match;
from barrow's shores to paraguay,
great lakes or ocean's wave,
the coast guard fought
through storms and winds
to punish or to save.
we're always ready for the call,
we place our trust in thee.
through howling gale and shot and shell,
to win our victory.
'semper paratus' is our guide,
our pledge, our motto, too.
we're 'always ready,' do or die!
aye! coast guard, we fight for you.
aye, we've been 'always ready'
to do, to fight, or die
write glory to the shield we wear
in letters to the sky.
to sink the foe or save the maimed
our mission and our pride
we'll carry on 'til kingdom come
ideals for which we've died.
we're always ready for the call,
we place our trust in thee.
through howling gale and shot and shell,
to win our victory.
'semper paratus' is our guide,
our pledge, our motto, too.
we're 'always ready,' do or die!
aye! coast guard, we fight for you."
Arthur McBride,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=20,"i had a young cousin named arthur mcbride
he and took a stroll down by the seaside
a seekin' good fortune and what might be tide
bein' just as the day was a dawnin'
and then after restin' we both took a tram
to meet sergeant harper and corporal cram
beside the wee drummer who beat up the camp
with his rowdy dow dow in the mornin'
he said, ""me young fellows if you will enlist
a guinea you quickly shall have in your fist
besides a crown for to kick up the dust
and to drink the king's health in the morning""
had we been such a fool as to take the advance
with a wee bit of money we'd have to run chance
""do you think it no scruples to send us to france
where we should be killed in the morning?""
he said, ""me young fellows if i hear but one word
i instantly now will out with my sword
and into your bodies as strength will support
so now me gay devils take warnin!""
but arthur and i we both took the odds
and we gave them no chance for to launch out their swords
our whackin' shillelaghs came over their heads
and we paid them right smart in the morning
and as for the drummer, we rifled his pouch
and we made a football of his rowdy dow dow
and into the ocean to rock and to roll
barin' the day it's returnin'
and as for the rapier he hung by his side
we threw it as far as we could in the tide
""to the devil i pit you!"" says arthur mcbride,
""to temper your steel in the mornin'"""
Artist on the RTA,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=549,"this is in response to the viral youtube video
of a cleveland bus driver being assaulted by a passenger until he couldnt take it anymore.
let me tell you the story about a man named artis
who was bussin for the rta
for 25 years he never had a problem
till he met a certain shi dea lane
now shi dea lane was standin by the driver
till artis couldnt take it no more
this bitch was cursin all up in his grill
and acting like a crazy crack whore
did he show some restraint
(no there was no restraint)
this bitch was about to get crushed
then things got ugly with a camera was rollin
for an uppercut on a downtown bus
he said ill bring my grand daughter up here
to whoop yo ass
what was the driver to do
she said  bring them n-word her and yo nanny bitch
and ill beat her ass too
then shi dea lane walked over to artis
and hit him while he was driving and how
witness reported that she spit on him too
he said, you going to jail now
then atrist reared back with a wide toed stance
that made tyson and larry holmes proud
and there was a mighty crack and silence for a second
for once this bitch wasnt so loud
then all in one motion he grabbed her by the weave
and out the front door she flew
he even showed her courtesy by ditching her
belongings in one motion with the follow through
than a passenger yelled, you can hear her on the tape
thats a f-ing word female!
he said,i dont care she wanna be a man
im gunna treat you like a man
now shi dea lanes jaw was workin fine
spewing threats without a hitch
heres the last thing she said as the tape was ending
my n-word gunna to beat he breast off you bitch"
As I Roved Out,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=21,"and who are you, me pretty fair maid

she took me horse by the bridle and the bit
and she led him to the stable ( repeat )
saying ""there's plenty of oats for a soldier's horse,
to eat it if he's able.""

then she took me by the lily-white hand
and she led me to the table ( repeat )
saying ""there's plenty of wine for a soldier boy,
to drink it if you're able.""

then i got up and made the bed
and i made it nice and aisy ( repeat )
then i got up and laid her down

and there we lay till the break of day
and divil a one did hear us ( repeat )
then i arose and put on me clothes
saying ""lassie, i must leave you.""

and when will you return again
and when will we get married ( repeat )
when broken shells make christmas bells
we might well get married."

and wandered in the lovely vale
where tall trees whisper all the tale

where fame and ancient glory fate
such was the land where he was laid

has nursed parnell, our grandest gael
and cursed the land that has betrayed
fair avondale's proud eagle"
Back Home in Derry,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=23,"in 1803 we sailed out to sea
out from the sweet town of derry
for australia bound if we didn't all drown
and the marks of our fetters we carried.
in the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains
as our good wives we left in sorrow.
as the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled
on the english and thoughts of tomorrow.
oh oh oh oh i wish i was back home in derry.
oh oh oh oh i wish i was back home in derry.
i cursed them to hell as our bow rode the swell.
our ship danced like a moth in the firelights.
white horses rode high as the devil passed by
taking souls to hades by twilight.
five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three
our comrades we buried each morning.
in our own slime we were lost in a time.
endless night without dawning.   
van dieman's land is a hell for a man
to live out his life in slavery.
when the climate is raw and the gun makes the law.
neither wind nor rain cares for bravery.
twenty years have gone by and i've ended me bond
and comrades' ghosts are behind me.
a rebel i came and i'ii die the same.
on the cold winds of night you will find me  "
Back Home To Ireland (for the 1st time)O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=24,"there's a spirit that flows in an irishman's soul
and carries within it, all the dreams of the past
deep in our memories are the greatest of those
believers, and dreamers, who died with a hope
that the freedom ship sails
with an irish flag high on its mast
those who can realize these feelings of pride
to be linked to the people of this storied land
i return to this island and know deep inside
the stongest, the bravest, the faithful and true
grant me welcome with smiles, and joy
in their open hands
back home to ireland for the first time
as i gaze on your fields and your shores
in each irishman's heart
there's a part of you inside
in my heart i have been here before
time calls upon me to fly o're the sea
to answer those voices, they're calling me home
the history has taught me what i am to love
my family, my country, to worship my god
it's your spirit that lives
in my heart and the depths of my soul"
Back to Nine Island O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=25,"it's red right returning
on back to nine island
hauling our catch
farewell to the sea
for home our heart's yearning
as we view the highlands
we're riding the crest
and our spirits are free
we're dreaming of camp
as the main sail's unfurling
the evening is blessed
with a favoring wind
our faces are chapped
from the weeks of our toiling
while our labors have kept us
from drinking and sin
with thoughts of our docking
all faces are smiling
the haul is a bumper
well blessed by the man
life's pleasures are best
when your heart it is pining
and ever more joyful
when they're close at hand 
the sun in the west
as it's drifting and lazing
shines and reflects
on the houses ashore
it seemingly sets
all the windows a  blazing
our hearts they will leap
when we walk thru their doors
our faces will glow
like the campfires burning
we'll drink up the time
with our family and friends
we'll cherish the time
for soon we're returning
it's moments at camp
we wish they'd never end  
the first night at camp
will last till sun's dawning
with tales of the past
full of laughter and song
the glasses we drank
will soon lend to our yawning
it's here all are welcome
it's here you belong
we easily lose
all our thoughts of employment
enjoying all things
as we're fast on the shore
when the day soon arives
and we're bound for deployment
we'll plan our returning
when we leave once more  "
Ballad of St. Anne,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=458,"he was stranded in some tiny town
on fair prince edward island
waiting for a ship to come
and find him
a one horse place, a friendly face,
some coffee and a tiny trace
of fiddlin' in the distance
far behind him
a dime across the counter then,
a shy hello, a brand new friend
a walk along the street in the wintry weather
a yellow light, an open door,
a 'welcome friend, there's room for more'
and then they're standing there inside together he said 'i've heard that tune before somewhere but i can't remember when
was it on some other friendly shore,
did i hear it on the wind
was it written on the sky above,
i think i heard it from someone i love
but i never heard it sound so sweet since then how his feet begin to tap, a little boy says 'i'll take your hat'
he's caught up in the magic of his smile
then leaps the heart inside him
when and off across the floor he sends
his clumsy body, graceful as a child he said
'there's magic in the fiddler's arms and there's magic in this town
there's magic in the dancers' feet and the way they put them down
smiling people everywhere, boots and ribbons and locks of hair
laughter and old blue suits and easter gowns' the sailor's gone, the room is bare, the old piano's sitting there
someone's hat's left hanging on the rack
some empty chairs, the wooden floor that feels the touch of shoes no more
waiting for the dancers to come back
and the fiddle's in the closet of some daughter of the town
strings are broke and the bow is gone and the case is buttoned down
but often on december nights when the air is cold and the wind is right there's a melody comes passing through this town"
BallyJamesDuff,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=26,"the garden of eden has vanished, they say
but i know the lie of it still;
just turn to the left at the bridge of fenagh
and stop when halfway to cootehill.
'tis there i will find it,
i know sure enough
when fortune has come to me call,
oh the grass it is green around ballyjamesduff
and the blue sky is over it all.
and tones that are tender and tones that are gruff
are whispering over the sea,
""come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff
come home, paddy reilly, to me"".
my mother once told me that when i was born
the day that i first saw the light,
i looked down the street on that very first morn
and gave a great crow of delight.
now most newborn babies appear in a huff,
and start with a sorrowful squall,
but i knew i was born in ballyjamesduff
and that's why i smiled on them all.
the baby's a man, now he's toil-worn and tough
still, whispers come over the sea,
""come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff
come home, paddy reilly, to me"".
the night that we danced by the light of the moon,
wid phil to the fore wid his flute,
when phil threw his lip over ""come again soon"",
he's dance the foot out o' yer boot!
the day that i took long magee by the scruff
for slanderin' rosie kilrain,
then, marchin' him straight out of ballyjamesduff,
assisted him into a drain.
oh, sweet are the dreams, as the dudeen i puff,
of whisperings over the sea,
""come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff
come home, paddy reilly, to me"".
i've loved the young women of every land,
that always came easy to me;
just barrin' the belles of the black-a-moor brand
and the chocolate shapes of feegee.
but that sort of love is a moonshiny stuff,
and never will addle me brain,
for the bells will be ringin' in ballyjamesduff
for me and me rosie kilrain!
and through all their glamour, their gas and their guff
a whisper comes over the sea,
""come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff
come home, paddy reilly, to me"".
i've struck oil at last!
i've struck work, and i vow
i've struck some remarkable clothes,
i've struck a policeman for sayin' that now,
i'd go back to my beautiful rose.
the belles they may blarney,
the boys they may bluff
but this i will always maintain,
no place in the world like ballyjamesduff
no girl like rosie kilrain.
i've paid for my passage, the sea may be rough
but borne on each breeze there will be,
""come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff
come home, paddy reilly, to me""."
Band Played Waltzing Matilda (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=27,"when i was a young man i carried me pack
and i lived the free life of the rover.
from the murry's green basin to the dusty outback,
well, i waltzed my matilda all over.
then in 1915 my country said, ""son,
it's time you stop rambling, there's work to be done.""
so they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
and they marched me away to the war.
and the band played waltzing matilda,
as the ship pulled away from the quay
and midst all the cheers, flag waving and tears,
we sailed off for gallipoli
it's well i remember that terrible day,
how our blood stained the sand and the water
and of how in that hell that they called suvla bay
we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
johnny turk, he was ready, he primed himself well.
he rained us with bullets, and showered us with shell,
and in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell,
nearly blew us back home to australia.
and the band played waltzing matilda,
as we stopped to bury our slain,
and we buried ours, and the turks buried theirs,
then we started all over again.
those who were livinge just tried to survive
in that mad world of blood, death and fire.
and for ten weary weeks i kept myself alive
while around me the corpses piled higher.
then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head
and when i awoke in me hospital bed
and saw what it had done, sure i wished i was dead.
i never knew there were worse things than dying.
for i'll go no more waltzing matilda,
all around the green bush far and free
to hunt and to pace, a man needs both legs,
no more waltzing matilda for me.
they collected the crippled, the wounded, the maimed,
and they sent us back home to australia.
the armless, the legless, the blind and the insane,
those proud wounded heroes of suvla.
and when our ship pulled into circular quay
i looked at the place where me legs used to be
and thanked christ there was no one there waiting for me
to grieve, to mourn and to pity.
but the band played waltzing matilda
as they carried us down the gangway,
but nobody cheered, they just stood and stared,
then they turned all their faces away.
so now every april i sit on my porch
and i watch the parade pass before me.
and i see my old comrades, how proudly they march
reliving their dreams and past glory,
i see the old men all tired, stiff and sore
those forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
and the young people ask ""what are they marching for?""
and i ask myself the same question.
but the band plays waltzing matilda,
and the old men still answer the call,
but year after year, the numbers get fewer
someday, no one will march there at all.
waltzing matilda, waltzing matilda.
who'll come a-waltzing matilda with me?
and their ghosts can be heard as they march by the billibong
who'll come a-waltzing matilda with me?"
Bangor Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=530,"one day down in bangor,
i called on miss brown
she was up in her bath
so she couldn't come down,
says i slip on something
and come down here quick
so she slipped on the soap
and was down in a tic.
on day at the market
i bought a wee hen,
i thought i would like a fresh egg
now and then,
but the very next morning
i got a great shock
says the hen i can't lay
sure i'm only a cock.
one day i was walking down the main street,
i met a wee lad with no shoes to his feet.
i took pity on him then and there
and went into a fruit shop and bought him a pear.
i once met a man with a hole in his head,
sure they took out my brains for to mend them he said.
that's awkward says i but says he not at all
sure i'm only a deputy up in the dail (minister in parliament)
i met an auld man at a funeral one day
his back it was stooped and his hair it was grey,
i'm close on a hundred he said with a groan.
faith says i you are wasting your time to go home.
i drempt i did die and to heaven did go.
the place that i came from
they wanted to know
says i i'm from bangor,
saint peter did stare' hurry up, step inside,
you're the first one from there"
Banks of My Own Lovely Lee,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=28,"how oft do my thoughts in their fancy take flight
to the home of my childhood away,
to the days when each patriot's vision seem'd bright
ere i dreamed that those joys should decay.
when my heart was as light as the wild winds that blow
down the mardyke through each elm tree,
where i sported and play'd 'neath each green leafy shade
on the banks of my own lovely lee.
and then in the springtime of laughter and song
can i ever forget the sweet hours?
with the friends of my youth as we rambled along
'mongst the green mossy banks and wild flowers.
then too, when the evening sun's sinking to rest
sheds its golden light over the sea
the maid with her lover the wild daisies pressed
on the banks of my own lovely lee
the maid with her lover the wild daisies pressed
on the banks of my own lovely lee
'tis a beautiful land this dear isle of song
its gems shed their light to the world
and her faithful sons bore thro' ages of wrong,
the standard st. patrick unfurled.
oh! would i were there with the friends i love best
and my fond bosom's partner with me
we'd roam thy banks over, and when weary we'd rest
by thy waters, my own lovely lee,
we'd roam thy banks over, and when weary we'd rest
by thy waters, my own lovely lee,
oh what joys should be mine ere this life should decline
to seek shells on thy sea- girdled shore.
while the steel-feathered eagle, oft splashing the brine
brings longing for freedom once more.
oh all that on earth i wish for or crave
is that my last crimson drop be for thee,
to moisten the grass of my forefathers' grave
on the banks of my own lovely lee
to moisten the grass of my forefathers' grave
on the banks of my own lovely lee."
Banks of the Ohio,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=29,"i met my love, to take a walk
to take a walk, just a little walk
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks, of the ohio
and only say, that you'll be mine
and in no other's arms entwine
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks, of the ohio
i held her close against my chest
and held a knife against her breat
she cried, ""oh, willie, don't murder me!
i'm not prepared, for eternity!""  
i stared home, 'tween twelve and one
and cried, ""my god,! what have i done?""
""i killed the only woman i loved
because she would not be my bride!""  "
Banks of the Roses,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=30,"on the banks of the roses, my love and i sat down
and i took out my violin to play my love a tune
in the middle of the tune, o she sighed and she said
o johnny, lovely johnny, would you leave me
o when i was a young man, i heard my father say
that he'd rather see me dead and buried in the clay
sooner than be married to any runaway
by the lovely sweet banks of the roses
o then i am no runaway and soon i'll let them know
i can take a good glass or leave it alone
and the man that doesn't like me, he can keep
his daughter home
and young johnny will go roving with another
and if ever i get married, twill be in the month of may
when the leaves they are green and the meadows
they are gay
and i and my true love can sit and sport and play
on the lovely sweet banks of the roses"
Bard of Armagh,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=31,"oh list to the lay of a poor irish harper
and scorn not the strings of his old withered hands
but remember these fingers could once move more sharper
to waken the echos of his dear native land
it was long before the shamrock our green isle loved emblem
was crushed in its beauty neath the saxon lion's paw
it was called by the colleens in village and valley
bold phelam o'brady, the bard of armagh
how i long to muse on the days of my boyhood
though four scores and trhee years have flitted since then
still it gives sweet reflections as every young joy should
that merry hearted boys make the best of ould men
at a pattern or fair i could twist my shillelagh
or trip through a jig with my brouges bound with straw
whilst all pretty maidens around me assembled
loved bold phelam o'brady, the bard of armagh
although i have travelled this wide world all over
yet erin's my home and a parent to me
then oh! let the ground that my ould bones shall cover
be cut from the soil that is trod by the free
and when sergeant death in his cold arm shall embrace me
to lull me to sleep with sweet erin go bragh

i find this song is more interesting when you add the people's names
who are with you. the challenge is remembering them in the order
they're named. if not, a ""penalty drink"" is enforced. the object is to finish
the entire pint in the song. the company is the last verse and swigging the remainder is required to finish it off. i usually begin the names after the barrell. the new record so far is listing 87 in the song, at the flat iron cafe' in cleveland 5/23/03. the old record was 84 set at the sit and bull pub thanksgiving eve 2002."

i'm longing to call her my own
i'll not be contented, until she has consented,
to be mistress barney malone
i met this fair treasure, while walking for pleasure,
she looked up at me then she cried
without any warning 'the top of the morning'
and then up to her i replied  come, come, beautiful eileen,
come for a drive with me
over the mountain, down by the fountain
over the high road and down by the low road
make up your mind, don't be unkind
and we'll drive to castlebar
to the road i'm no stranger
for you there's no danger
so just come along in my old jaunting car
now eileen said 'no sir, with you i won't go,
sir don't think it ungrateful of me
i'd rather go walking, than have people talking
you know what the story would be'
'no eileen my jewel, don't treat me so cruel
to treat me this way is a shame

Beautiful Meath,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=464,"i've travelled many counties in ireland
but there's still one i'm longing to see.
it has been a part of my homeland
and it brings back fond memories to me,
where i wandered alone in my childhood
reviewing the sights i once seen,
as i walked through the parks and the forests
'round the beautiful county of meath.
: oh, beautiful meath,
you've got all that i need. y
our rivers they flow with delight.
your fields are so green,
there's plains to be seen,
and your towns are so gay and so bright.
fishing down on the boyne,
i remember the time
you would think it was all just a dream;
and wherever you roam,
there's no place like home
and the beautiful county of meath.
i've seen its beautiful castles,
and its history i've learned so well.
i've read of the high kings of tara
and the wonderful book of kells.
where the slain still remember st. patrick,
he lit a fire for the people to see,
'ere he brought love and kindness to ireland
and the beautiful county of meath.

Beer Beer Beer (Charlie Mopps),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=34,"a long time ago, way back in history,
when all they had to drink was nothing but cups of tea,
along came a mane by the name of charlie mopps,
and he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops
he might have been an admiral,
a sultan or a king
and to his praises we shall always sing.
look what he has done for us: he's filled us with cheer.
god bless charlie mopps, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddily beer beer beer
a barrel of malt a bucket of hops
and add some yeast
put it all together and let it ferment and swell
when it's brewed and ready at 11 o'clock we'll stop
for 5 short seconds we'll remember charlie mopps

at carnsies and the flat iron
and pickle bill's as well
one thing i can be sure of
it's charlie's beer they sell

Before We Were Married O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=35,"novelty song
before we were married
you had shaven silky legs
before we were married
well, i never had to beg
before we were married
you wanted lovin' every night
before we were married
we left on the bedroom light
but now that we are married
you've got sandpaper on your thighs
you've memorized the pattern of
the bedroom ceoling tiles
your moaning in the bedroom consists of
""please! don't touch my hair!""
and i think that i'm bisexual
cause i have sex...twice a year
since we are married
i live in this institution
i'm afraid to say my manhood's
getting rather lillipution
i'm workin' out 3 times a week
workin' on a callous
but there's one marriage skill i've learned,
now i'm ambidextrous
before we were married
oh how you used to squeel
i had a car with headroom
a nice tilt steering wheel
your lap was hot and steamey
and you wiggled like a cat
i wondered if you dumped
mcdonald's coffee in your lap
but now that we are married
and the kids are growing old
you're so afraid they'll hear us
they're walkin' birth control
i'm beggin' for some lovin'
and you say,""get off my back!""
if you were any colder
i'd be a necrophiliac!
i lie awake in bed at night
thinkin',""this is quite a pickle!""
you used to be so ticklish
but you don't want my test tickles
it makes no difference if i wear
a raincoat or a speedo
this marriage license costs too much
3 bucks and your libido"
Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=36,"believe me if all those endearing young charms
which i gaze on so fondly today
were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms
like fairy gifts fading away
thou wouldst still be adored
as this moment thou art
let thy lovliness fade as it will
and around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
would entwine itself verdantly still
it is not while beauty and youth are thine own
and thy cheek unprofaned by a tear
that the fervor and faith of a soul can be known
to which time will but make thee more dear
oh the heart that has loved never truly forgets
but as truly lives on to the close
as the sunflower turns on her god as he sets
the same look that she gave when he rose"
Ben Bulben of Sligo,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=37,"high up on ben bulben and its green grassy slope
where the sheep are so peacefully grazing
alone with my thoughts adn my youth's secret hopes
'neath the clouds i'll be cheerfully lazing
there on that mountain alone i would go
while life held its treasures before me
nature around me was waking anew
and care was as rare as the moon when it's blue
ben bulben of sligo majestic you stand to welcome me back from my travels
when i see the mountain i know i've come home forever and ever no more to roam
often at daybreak from my cottage i've seen
the sun rising over the mountain
reflecting the glories of sligo and me
and each blessing i'd surely be counting
oh where in the world would the grass be so green
as the rainfull caressing ?
wild geese go flying on ben bulben's heights
meeting the dawn with their morning flights  
land of the poet where yeats gave us first
he was raised in the county of sligo
mem'ries more precious than coins in the purse
i'll treasure forever where i go
the sounds in the valley as the streams gently flow
as they wind their was down to the sea
and the wild mountain heather that blooms all year 'round
will one day have a hearty welcome for me"
Biddy McGraw,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=38,"oh let me tell you of a story that will give you a shock
a story'bout a murder on st. john's dock

and she strangled two sailors with the straps of her bra
too rah hoo rah hah,  fiddle dee da ra
too rah too rah too rah hah
well they tried to get her drunk on her own corn liquor
but as quick as they were be jaysus she was quicker
she remembered she was told by her ma and her da
to keep both hands on the straps of yer bra  
so she wrapped those straps around the big sailor's head
and she threw him in the river like a crust of bread
then the small sailor laughed and he said ""haw haw""
so she stuffed his gob with the rest of her bra
his face turned purple and before he fell...
she picked up her miniskirt and ran like hell 
she went home that night 'bout a quarter to one
happy and contented with a job well done
she told her story to her ma and her da
they said,""tanks be to god you were wearin' yer bra!""  
now all you ladies who go walking late at night
don't keep the straps of yer bra too tight
just remember the story of biddy mcgraw
and keep both yer hands on the straps of yer bra  "

from francis street back to the coombe;
but where would you see a fine widow like me?
biddy mulligan the pride of the coombe, me boys,
biddy mulligan the pride of the coombe.
i'm a buxom fine widow, i live in a spot in dublin, they call it the coombe.
me shops and me stalls are laid out on the street, and me palace consists of one room.
i sell apples and oranges, nuts and sweet peas, bananas and sugar stick sweet.
on a saturday night i sell second-hand clothes, from the floor of me stall in the street.
i sell fish on a friday, spread out on a board  the finest you'll find in the sea.
but the best is my herrings, fine dublin bay herrings,
there's herrings for dinner and tea.
i have a son, mick, he's great on the flute, he plays in the longford street band;
it would do your heart good for to see him march out
on a sunday for dollymount strand.   
in the park, on a sunday, i make quite a dash the neighbors look on in surprise.
with my aberdeen shawlie thrown over my head, i dazzle the sight of their eyes.
at patrick street corner, for sixty-four years, i've stood, and no one can deny
that while i stood there, nobody could dare to say black was the white of my eye."
Big Strong Man a.k.a. My Brother Sylvest,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=40,"have you heard about the big strong man?
he lives in a caravan
have you heard about the jeffery johnson fight
it's one hell of a fight
you can take every heavy weight you've got
we've got a lad who can beat the whole lot
he used to ring the bells in the belfry no he's gonna fight
jack dempsey...
he was my brother sylvest  (shout-what's he got?)
a row of forty medals on his chest (big chest!)
he killed fifty badmen in the west
he knew no rest, thinkin' a man's hell fire
don't push, just shove, plenty of room for you and me
he's got an arm (got an arm!)
like a leg (like a leg!)
and a punch that can sick a battle ship (big ship!)
it takes all the army and the navy to put the wind up sylvest
well he'd thought he'd take a trip to italy
he thought he'd take a trip by sea
he jumped in the harbour in new york
swam like a great big ould shark
he saw the lusitania in distress (what'd he do?)
he put the lusitania on his chest (big chest!)
drank up all the water in the sea and walked all the way to italy  
well he thought he'd take a trip to old japan
they brought out the big brass band
he played every instrument they had (what a lad!)
he played the whole lot
well the church bells all will ring (ding dong) or hell's bells
and the church choirs all will sing (laaaaa!) or hell's fire
they'll all come out to bid farewell to my big brother sylvest  "
Billy Reed,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=414,"i'll sing you a song, of a terrible wrong
and the flags they flew at half mast
and a man he lay dead, he was riddled with lead
and he died on the streets of belfast
 o the radio said, twas another shot dead
and he died with a gun in his hand
but they didnt say why, billy reed had to die
but he died to free ireland
ir happened one day when the bold i.r.a.
went out to fight for their land
with an old thompson gun brought the troops on the run
and defense of their homes was their plan.
when returning the gun
billy met with these huns
and when the fight had begun
his position was dire, but his gun wouldnt fire
so he died with that old thompson gun.
although he lay dead, he was kicked in the head
by the hair they dragged him around
for they still feared him yet and can never forget
how brave billy reed stood his ground.
if you think he was right,
come and join in the fight
and help to free belfast
for the blood that he shed,
although he lay dead
in our hearts his memory will last.

Black and Tans,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=41,"i was born on a dublin street where the royal drums do beat
and the loving english feet they tramped all over us,
and each and every night when me father'd come home tight
he'd invite the neighbors outside with this :
so come out you black and tans,
come out and fight me like a man
show your wife how you won medals fown in flanders
tell them how the ira
made you run like hell away,
from the green and lovely lanes in killashandra.
come let me hear you tell
how you slandered brave pernell,
how you fought him well and truly persecuted,
where are the snears and jeers
that that give out a little cheer
when our leaders of sixteen were executed.
come tell us how you slew
them old arabs two by two
like the zulus they had spears and bows and arrows,
how you bravely faced each one
with your sixteen pound of gun
and you frightened them poor natives to the marrow.  
allen, larkin, and o'brien--
how you bravely called them swine!
robert emmett who you hung and drew and quartered!
high upon that scaffold high,
how you murdered henry joy!
and our croppy boys from wexford you did slaughter!   
the day is coming fast
and the time is here at last,
when each yeoman will be cast aside before us,
and if there be a need
sure my kids wil sing, ""godspeed!""

apprenticed to trade i was bound
and manys the hour of sweet happiness
i spent in that neat little town
till bad misfortune came o're me
which sent me away from the land
far away from my friends and companions
betrayed by the black velvet band 
as i went strolling down broadway
not intending to stray very far
i met with a frolicksome damsel
applying her trade in a bar
a watch she stole from a customer
and slipped it right into my hand
the very first day that i met her,

both of us were to appear
a gentleman claimed his jewelry
and the case against us was quite clear
seven long years transportation
right down to van dieman's land
far away from my friends and companions
betrayed by the black velvet band

i'll have you take warnin' by me

'twas over in ould ireland near the town of cushendall,
one morn i met a damsel there, the fairest of them all.
'twas with my young affections and my money did she go,
and she told me she belonged to where the blarney roses grow. 
her cheeks were like the roses, her hair a raven hue.
before that she was done with me, she had me raving too.
she left me sorely stranded, not a coin she left, you know,

they've roses in killarney, and the same in county clare,
but 'pon my word those roses, boys, i can't see anywhere.
she blarney'd me and, by the powers, she left me broke -- ho, ho! -- did this damsel that belonged to where the blarney roses grow. 
acushla gra-machree, me boys, she murmured soft, did she,
'if you belong to ireland, it's yourself belongs to me.'

Bodhran Song (The),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=476,"oh i am a year old kid i'm worth scarcely fifteen quid.
i'm the kind of beast you might well look down on
but my value will increase at the time of my decease
for when i grow up i want to be a bodhrán.
if you kill me for my meat you won't find me very sweet.
your palate i'm afraid i'll soon turn sour on.
ah but if you do me in for the sake of my thick skin
you'll find i make a tasty little bodhrán.
now my parents bill and nan, they do not approve my plan
to become a yoke for every yob to pound on
ah but i would sooner scamper with a bang than with a whimper and achieve reincarnation as a bodhrán.
i look forward to the day when i leave off eating hay
and become a drum to entertain a crowd on
and i'll make my presence felt with each well-delivered belt
as a fully qualified and licensed bodhrán.
and 'tis when i'm killed and cured my career will be assured
i'll be a skin you'll see no scum nor scour on
but with studs around my rim i'll be sound in wind and limb
and i'll make a dandy, handy little bodhrán.
oh my heart with joy expands when i dream of far-off lands
and consider all the streets that i will sound on
and i pity my poor ma who has never seen a fleadh
or indulged in foreign travel as a bodhrán.
for a hornpipe or a reel a dead donkey has no feel
or a horse or cow or sheep that has its shroud on
and you can't join in a jig if you're a former grade
a pig but you can wallop out the lot if you're a bodhrán.
so if e'er you're feeling low to a session you should go
and bring me there to exercise an hour on.
you can strike a mighty thump on my belly, back or rump
but i thank you if you'd wait till i'm a bodhrán.
when i dedicate my hide, i'll enhance the family pride
and tradition is a thing i won't fall down on
for i'll bear a few young bucks who'll inherit my good looks
and be proud to know their old one is a bodhrán.
and i don't think i'll much mind when i've left himself behind
for the critter can no longer turn the power on
for with a celtic ink design tattooed on my behind
i can be a very sexy little bodhrán
now i think you've had enough of this rubbishy old guff
so i'll put a sudden end to my wee amhrán
and quite soon my bloody bleat
will become a steady beat
when i start my new existence as a bodhrán."
Bold O'Donahue,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=45,"well, here i am from paddy's land, a land of high renown
i've broke the hearts of all the girls for miles round keady town
and when they hear that i'm awa' they'll raise a hullabaloo
when they hear about that handsome lad they call jack donahue!
well now i'm the boy to squeeze her, and i'm the boy to tease her
i'm the boy that can please her up and i'll tell you what i'll do
i'll court her like an irishman
wi' me brogue and blarney too is me plan
with the holligan, rolligan, swolligan, molligan bold o'donahue!
i wish my love was a red. red rose growing on yon garden wall
and me to be a dewdrop and upon her brow i'd fall!
perhaps now she might think of me as a rather heavy dew
and no more she'd love that handsome lad they call o'donahue!
well i hear that queen victoria has a daughter fine and grand
perhaps she'd take it into her head for to marry an irishman
and if i could only get the chance to have a word or two
i'm sure she'd take a notion to the bold o'donahue!"
Bold Thaddy Quill,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=46,"ye maids of dulhallow who are anxious for courtin'
a word of advice i will give unto ye
preceed to the banteeer to the athletic sporting
and give in your names to the club committee
and never commence any sketch of your program
till the carriage you see coming over the hill
all down through the valleys and glens of kilcorney
with the muskerry sportsman, the bold thaddy quill
for ramblin for rovin for football and sportin'
for drinkin' black porter as fast as you fill
in all you days rovin' you'll find none so jovial
as the muskerry sportsman the bold thaddy quill
at the great hurling match between cork and tipperary
that was held in the park on the banks of the lee
our own darling boys were afraid of being beaten
so they sent for bold thaddy in ballinagree
well he hurled the ball left and right in their faces
he showed those tipperary boys daring and skill
if they touched on his lines he would certainly brain them
and the papers sang praises of the bold thaddy quill
at the cork exhibition there was a fair maiden
who's fortune exceeded one million or more
but a poor constitution had ruined her completely
and medical treatment had failed o're and o're
ah mother she says sure i know what will ease me
and all the diseases most certainly kill
give over your potions and medical treatment
i'd rather one squeeze from the bold thaddy quill"
Bonnie's Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=553,"you went  away in springtime
one april morn
who wouldve known that since that time
a memory was born
the love you gave us in your life
would stand the test of time
its not what you take with you
but what you leave behind
look around, look around and see
what you have done
thanks to all the friends youve made
your memory has won.
youre the keeper of the rainbows now
and guide among the stars
youre the keeper of the rainbows now
and guide among the stars
where can we find the likes of you
just look into our hearts
a gentle smile your sparkling eyes
and were not so far apart
youre helping people as youre missed
then were not so far
youre the keeper of the rainbows now
and guide among the stars
look around, look around and see
what you have done

your memory has won.

Bonny Kellswater,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=47,"here's a health to you bonny kellswater
where you get all the pleasures of life
where you get all the fishing and fowling
and a bonny wee lass for your wife.
oh it's down where yon waters run muddy
i'm afraid they will never run clear
and it's when i begin for to study
my mind is on him that's not here.
and it's this one and that one may court him
but if any one gets him but me
it's early and late i will curse them
the parting lovely willie from me.
oh a father he calls on his daughter
two choices i'll give unto thee
would you rather see willie's ship a sailing
see him hung like a dog on yonder tree.
oh father, dear father, i love him
i can no longer bide it from thee
through an acre of fire i would travel
along with the lovely willie to be.
oh hard was the heartbreak i'm finding
she took from her full heart's delight
may the chains of old ireland come find them
and softly their pillows at night.
oh yonder there's a ship on the ocean
and she does not know which way to steer
from the east and the west she's a-blowing
she reminds me of the charms of my dear.
oh it's yonder my willie will be coming
he said he'd be here in the spring
and it's down by yon green shades i'll meet him
and among wild roses we'll sing.
for a gold ring be placed on my finger
saying love bear this in your mind
if ever i sail from old ireland
you'll mind i'll not leave you behind.
here's a health to you bonny kellswater
where you get all the pleasures of life
where you get all the fishing and fowling
and a bonny wee lass for your wife."
Boston Burglar,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=48,"i was born in the town of boston,
a town you all know well
brought up by honest parents
the truth to you i'll tell
brought up by honest parents
and raised most tenderly
'till i became a sporting lad
at the age of twenty-three
my character was taken
and i was sent to jail
my friends they came and tried in vain
to get me out on bail
the jury found me guilty
the clerk he wrote it down
the judge he passed the sentence
i was bound for charlestown
they sent me on the eastbound train
one cold december day
and every station we passed through
you could hear the people say
"" there goes the boston burglar
in cold chains he isbound
'for one crime or another
he is bound for charlestown.""
there was my aged father
a standing at the bar
likewise me dear old mother
a tearing down her hair
she was tearing down her old grey locks
and trembling as she said
""my son, my son what have you done
to be taken to charlestown?""
there lives a girl in boston
a girl that i love well
if ever i gain my liberty
it's with that girl i'll dwell
if ever i gain my liberty
there are two things i'll shun
that being a night street walker
and drinking of the rum
now come all ye men of boston
take warnin' if you can
and never roam the streets at night
breaking laws of god and man
for if you do you'll surely rue
and you'll wind up like me
serving up full twenty years in the penitentiary"
Boston Rose,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=49,"so goodbye my boston beauty farewell my boston rose
i'll wait for you, i'll think of you, no threat to you i'll pose
so goodbye my boston beauty, farewell my boston rose
i wish that you were here but i know, that's the way life goes
now the autumn leave are falling and the tourists have all gone
and the children
they have all gone back to school
and my life is as it was before, i work eight hours a day
but the company's still making all the rules
there's a girl in massachusettes, south of boston town they say
her lovely face is with me all the day
well i met her down in old tralee, golden hair upon her head
i won her heart but she stole mine away  
there's a song we sang all summer in the bars in dublin town
i can hear it on the fac'try radio
and the feelings i remember, when i hear that simple tune
makes me wonder if it ever happened so
well we laughed and loved together 'till the summer days were gone
and she had to fly across that ocean wide
so goodbye my boston beauty and until we meet again
i'll keep the fire burning deep inside  
and some nights when i'm drinkin' and my friends have gathered 'round
and just for fun someone calls out your name
well i smile there with the rest of them but i can't hear a sound
i love you but to them it's all the same
and nights when i'm alone my love you come into my mind
and visions flash across that emerald isle
well i'll watch the moon there up above i'll leave this earth behind
and i'll call to you as i go sailing by  "
Botany Bay,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=50,"farewell to your bricks and morter,
farewell to your dirty lies
farewell to your gangers and gangplanks,
farewell to your overtime
for the good ship ""ragamuffin""
is standin' at the key
for to take out pat with a shovel on his back
to the shores of botany bay
as i roved out this mornin',
where the ship at anchor lays
to cammand a band of navies,
that i was to engage
well i thought i'd stop in for a drink
before i went away
for to take a trip on an emmigrant ship
to the shores of botany bay  
well the boss came down this morning',
he said, ""well pat you know?""
""if you don't get your navies out
i afraid you'll have to go""
so i asked him for my wages
and demanded all my pay
and i told him straight i was going to emmigrate
to the shores of botany bay  
and when i reach austrailia,
i'll go and dig for gold
there's plenty there for diggin' of

Bottles of Black Porter,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=51,"i was born so small and weak
no bottle could i touch
or touch until the nurse the order gave
go get that child some porter
and when to man's estate i grew
my medicine chart no bottles knew
nor potions pills or powder blue
but bottles of plain porter
churchill and dev are two good sports
but when churchill very out of sorts
asked from dev the irish ports
dev told him to stick to porter
some fear to swin the river lee
the shannon boyne or old liffy
but who wouldn't chance the irish sea
if frothy brine were porter
paddy flaherty on a skite
traveled pubs by day and night
but what did he drink when he got tight?
he called for pints of porter
and now my song has come to an end
my homeward way i soon must wend
i'm hoping that the gods will send
another round of porter"
Boulavogue,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=52,"at boulavogue, as the sun was setting
o'er bright may meadows of shelmalier,
a rebel hand set the heather blazing
and brought the neighbors from far and near.
then father murphy, from old kilcormack,
spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""arm! arm!"" he cried, ""for i've come to lead you,
for ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
he led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
the cowardly yeomen we put to flight;
'twas at the harrow the boys of wexford
showed bookey's regiment how men could fight.
look out for hirelings, king george of england,
search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
for father murphy of the county wexford
sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
we took camolin and enniscorthy,
and wexford storming drove out our foes;
'twas at slieve coillte our pikes were reeking
with the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
at tubberneering and ballyellis
full many a hessian lay in his gore;
ah, father murphy, had aid come over,
the green flag floated from shore to shore!
at vinegar hill, o'er the pleasant slaney,
our heroes vainly stood back to back,
and the yeos at tullow took father murphy
and burned his body upon the rack.
god grant you glory, brave father murphy,
and open heaven to all your men;
the cause that called you may call tomorrow
in another fight for the green again."
Boys From the County Armagh,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=417,"there's one fair county in ireland
with memories so glorious and grand
where nature has lavished its bounty
it's the orchard of erin's green land
i love her cathedral and city
once founded by patrick so true
and it bears in the heart of it's bosom the ashes of brian boru
it's my own irish home
far across the foam
although i've often left it
in foreign lands to roam
no matter where i wander
through cities near or far
sure, my heart's at home in old ireland
in the county of armagh
i've traveled that part of the county through
new town, fork hill, crossmaglen
around by the gap of mountnorris
and home by blackwater again
where the girls are so gay and so hearty
none fairer in erin go bragh
but where are the boys that can court them
like the boys from the county armagh?"
Boys From the County Mayo,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=53,"far away from the land of the shamrock and heather
in search of a living, as exiles we roam
and whenever we chance to assemble together
we think of the land where we once had a home:
but our homes are destroyed and our soil confiscated
the hand of the tyrant brought plunder and woe;
the fires are now quenched and our hearts desolated
in our once happy homes in the county mayo
long years have now passed since with hearts full of sorrow
the land of the shamrock we left far behind;
but how we would like to going back there tomorrow;
to the scenes of our youth, which we still bear in mind;
the days of our childhood, it's now we regret them
they cling to our vision wherever we go;
and the friends of our youth we shall never forget them
they too are exiled from the county mayo
from historic killala, from swinford to balla
ballyhaunis and westport and old castlebar
kiltimagh and claremorris, belmullet and erris
kilkelly and knock that is famed near and far;
balla, ballina, ballinrobe and bohola
keeloges and foxford a few miles below
newport and cong with old straide and manulla
charlestown too, in the county mayo
so boys pull together in all kinds of weather
don't show the white feather wherever you go
be like a brother and love one another
like stout hearted men from the county mayo"
Boys Of  Wexford (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=54,"in comes the captain's daughter, the captain of the yeos
saying brave united irishmen we'll ne're again be foes
a thousand punds i'll give you and fly from home with thee
i'll dress myself in man's attire and fight for liberty
we are the boys from wexford
who fought with heart and hand
to burst in twain the galling chain
and free our native land
and when we left out cabin boys we left with right goodwill
to see our friends and neighbors that were at vinegar hill
a young man from our ranks a cannon he let go
he slapped it into lord mountjoy a tyrant he laid low 
we bravely fought and conquered at ross and wexford town
and if we failed to keep them 'twas drink that brought us down
we had no drink beside us on tubberneering's day
depending on the long bright pike and well it worked it's way 
they came into our country our blood and waste to spill
but let them weep for wexford and think of oulart hill
'twas drink that still betrayed us of them we had no fear
for everyman could do his part like forth and shelmalier 
my curse upon all drinking it made our hearts full sore
for bravery won each battle but dronk lost evermore
and if for want of leaders we lost at vinegar hill
we're ready for another fight and love our country still"
Boys of Killybegs,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=55,"there are wild and rocky hills
on the coast of donegal
and their fisherman are hearty brave and free
and the big atlantic swell
is a thing they know right well
as they fight to take a living from the sea
with a pleasant rolling sea
and the herring running free
and the fleet all riding gently thru the foam
when the boats are loaded down
ther'll be singing in the town
when the boys of killybegs
come rolling home
well you've donned your rubber boots
and you've got your oilskins on
and you've checked your gear
to see that it's ok
and your jumper keeps you warm
for it's cold before the dawn
and you're ready to begin another day
then you've headed out to sea
and the wind is blowing free
and you've cast your nets
as rain begins to fall
but the sun comes riding high
and the clouds will soon roll by
and today you'll maybe
take a bumper haul
when the weather's blowing rough
and the work gets very tough
and the ropes will raise the welts
upon your hands
but you'll never leave the sea
for whomever you may be
when it's in your blood
it's hard to live on land
well there's purple on the hills
and there's green down by the shore
and the sun has spilled it's gold
upon the sea
and there's silver down below
where those herring fishes go
when we catch them
there'll be gold for you and me"
Boys of the Old Brigade,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=56,"where are the lads who stood with me

""oh father, why are you so sad,
on this bright easter morn?
when irishmen are proud and glad
of the land where they were born.""
""oh, son, i see in mem'ries view
a far-off distant day,
when, being just a boy like you,
i joined the i.r.a
in hills and farms the call to arms
was heard by one and all,
and from the glens came brave young men
to answer ireland's call.
'twas long ago we faced the foe,
the old brigade and me,
but by my side my god and i
so ireland might be free.
and now, my boy, i've told you why
on easter morn i sigh
for i recall my comrades all
from dark old days gone by,
i think of men who fought in vain
with rifle and grenade
may heaven keep the men who sleep
from the ranks of the old brigade."
Brave Frank Stagg,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=436,"( for vol. frank stagg, ira, who died on hunger strike in wakefield prison on the 12th of february 1976. his last wish was to be taken home to mayo and buried next to his comrade and friend, michael gaughan. free-state forces hijacked his body to prevent a republican funeral. they buried him in a grave not of his family's choosing and covered it over with concrete. nine months later an ira unit retrieved his body and with full military honours successfully carried out the last wish of brave frank stagg. )
in a cruel british prison, a brave irish soldier lies;
body thin and weak with hunger,
as the light fades from his eyes.
by his side  two women weeping,
one is old and one is young;
on their knees to god appealing,
in their soft sweet mayo tongue.
ah, my loves, the young man murmurs.
do not cry your tears for me,
for my time is nearly over,
and today i will be free.
i can see a bright sun shining
on my own green mayo fields,
and i see dear michael gaughan,
waiting there beneath the trees.
in that cruel british prison, just before the break of day, with his loved ones there beside him,
that brave soldier passed away.
but he lives in erins heart yet,
and wherever flies her flag,
irelands sons and irelands daughters,
will remember brave frank stagg.
yes he lives in erins heart yet,
and wherever flies her flag,
irelands sons and irelands daughters,
will remember brave frank stagg."
Brennan on the Moor,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=57,"oh it's of a brave young highway man this story i do tell
his name was willie brennan and from ireland he did dwell
it was from the kilworth mountains he commenced his wild career
and many a wealthy nobelman before him shook with fear
oh it's brennan on the moor, brennan on the moor
oh brave and undaunted was young brennan on the moor
one day upon the hightway as young willie he went down
he met the mayor of cashel about a mile from town
the mayor he knew his features he said ""young man,"" said he.
""your name is willie brennan you must come along with me!"" 
then willie's wife went into town porvisions for to buy
and when she saw her willie she began to weep and cry
she said, ""hand me that tenpenny!"" as soon as willie spoke
and handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloke 
now it's of this loaded blunderbuss the truth i will unfold
he made the mayor to tremble and robbed him of his gold
a hundred pounds was offered for his apprehention there
and then with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair 
now brennan bein' an outlaw upon the mountains high
with cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
he laughed at them with scorn until at last they say
by a false hearted woman brennen cruely was betrayed "
Bridget Flynn,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=58,"i've a nice little house and a cow or two with grass
a plant garden running by my door
i've a shelter for the hens and a stable for the ass
oh what could a man want more
i don't know maybe so but a bachelor's like is easy and it's free
i have lots to look after when i'm livin' all alone
sure nobody's lookin after me
well my father often tells me i should go and have a try
to find a girl who owns a bit of land
and i know the way he says it that there's someone on his mind
and me mother has the whole thing planned
i don't know, maybe so, it would mollify them so to agree
now there's little bridget flynn she's the girl i'd like to win
but she never has an eye for me
well now there's a little girl who is worth her weight in gold
and that's a decent dowery don't ye see
and i mean to go and ask her just as soon as i get home
if she'll come and have an eye for me
will she go, i don't know, but i'd love to have her sittin' on my knee
i would sing like a thrush in a hawthorn bush
if she'd come and have an eye for me"
Broad Black Brimmer,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=59,"there's a uniform that's hangin'
in what's known as father's room
a uniform so simple in its style
it's got no braid of gold nor silk
nor hat with feathered plume
but me mother has preserved it all the while
one day she had me try it on
a wish of mine for years
""in mem'ry of your father dear,"" she said
and when i put the sam brown on
she was smilin' through her tears
when i put the broad black brimmer
on me head
it's just a broad black brimmer
ribbons frayed and torn
in a careless whisk of manys about the breeze
an old trench coat that's all battle stained and worn
and breeches almost threadbare at the knees
a sam brown belt with a buckle big and strong
and a holster that's been empty manys a day (but not for long)
when ireland gets her freedom
the one they'll choose to lead 'em
will wear the broad black brimmer
of the i.r.a.
it's the uniform be worn by me father long ago
when he hit me mother's house flat on the run
it was the uniform be worn in that little church below
when father mike he blessed the pair as one
after truce and treaty and the parting of the ways
he wore it when he marched out with the rest
(and the best!)
and when they laid his body down
his brother's heads were raised
when they put the broad black brimmer
on his head"
Bryan O'Lynn,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=60,"bryan o'lynn was a gentleman born
he lived at a time when no clothes they were worn,
but as fashion went out, of course bryan walked in
""whoo, i'll lead the fashions,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no breeches to wear
he got him a sheepskin to make him a pair,
with the fleshy side out and the woolly side in,
""whoo, they're pleasant and cool."" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no shirt to his back,
he went to his neighbor's and borrowed a sack
then he puckered the meal bag up under his chin
""whoo, they'll take them for ruffles,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no hat to his head,
he thought that the pot would do him instead,
then he murdered murdered a cod for the sake of its fin,
""whoo, 'twill pass for a feather."" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn was hard up for a coat
he borrowed a skin of a neighboring goat
with the horns sticking out from his oxters, and then
""whoo, they'll take them for pistols,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no stockings to wear,
he bought him a rat's skin to make him a pair,
he then drew them on and they fitted his shin,
""whoo, they're illegant wear,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no brogues to his toes,
he hopped on two crab shells to serve him for those,
then he split up two oysters that matched just like twins,
""whoo, they'll shine out like buckles,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no watch to put on,
he scooped out a turnip to make him a one
then he planted a cricket in under the skin
""whoo, they'll think it's a-tickin,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn to his house had no door,
he'd the sky for a roof and the bog for a floor,
he'd a way to jump out and a way to swim in,
""whoo, it's very convanient,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn, his wife, and wife's mother,
they all went home o'er the bridge together,
the bridge it broke down and they all tumbled in,
""whoo, we'll go home by water,"" says bryan o'lynn.
brian o'lynn and his wife's mother
went under the bridge to piddle together
one piddled needles and one piddled pins
""that's mighty sharp piddling,"" says bryan o'lynn.
bryan o'lynn had no watch for to wear
he got a big turnip and scooped it out fair,
he put a live cricket right into it then,
""sure, they'll think it's a-ticking,"" says bryan o'lynn."
Bunch of Thyme,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=61,"come all you maidens young and fair
all you who are blooming in your prime
always beware and keep your garden fair

thyme brings all things to your mind
thyme with all its labors, along with all its joys
and its thyme brings all things to an end

and then a lusty sailor had chanced to pass my way
he stole my bunch of thyme away
the sailor gave to me a rose
i thought it never would decay

'tll apples grow on a cherry tree
i wish my baby, it was born
and seated on it's daddy's knee
and my poor body to be dead and gone
see the long green grass growing over me
she went upstairs to go to bed
to rest her body and her weary head
""bring me a chair that i might sit down
and a pen and ink, that i might write down""
he went upstairs, and the door he broke
he found her hanging by a rope
he took a knife and cut her down
and in her pocket these words he found
""oh make my grave, long wide and deep
with a marble stone at my head and feet
and in the middle, a turtle dove
that he world may know, i died for love"""
Caledonia,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=559,"i don't know if you can see
the changes that have come over me
in these last few days
i've been afraid thatimight drift away
so i've been telling old stories, singing songs,
that make me think about where i came from
that's the reason why i seem so far away today
let me tell you that i love you and i think about you all the time
caledonia you're calling me and now i'm going home
but if i should become a stranger
youknow that it would make me more than sad
caledonia's been everything i've ever had
i have moved and i've kept on moving,
proved the points that i needed proving
lost the friends that i needed losing, found others on the way
i have tried and i've kept on trying, stolen dreams, yes there's no denying*
i have traveled hard sometimes with conscience flying
somewhere in the wind
now i'm sitting here before the fire, the empty room, the forest choir
the flames that couldn't get any higher
well they've withered now they've gone
but i'm steady thinking, my way is clear
and i know what i will do tomorrow
when the hands have shaken and the kisses flow
then i will disappear"
Camp June O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=63,"nestled on a hill in a place not far away
is a cabin in the woods, you can watch the wildlife play
stand beneath majestic trees as the birds all sings their tune
is a place we love be, a place we call camp june
a place where families meet, a place to share our love
among the fallen leaves as the sun shines through above
even in our minds, we know we'll be there soon
deep within our memories, a place we call camp june
bridge
sitting by a crakling fireside
living out the best times of our lives
knowing all the days are filled with fun
swimming 'neath the comfort of the sun
working through the week even as the seasons change
we know there is a place that couldn't ever change
in our hearts there is a memory beneath a glowing moon
a place forever sacred, a place we love, camp june"

Carnsies Welcome Home Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=67,"many a blissful night i spent
right here in bingo town
with drinks delivered down the hatch
with friends all gathered 'round
we were all making memories
""more fun"" was our desire
but we never thought for once
we'd have a real life, ""mcintyre""
but we sighed and we swore
we'd all be back for more
when the hell is billy
going to open up the door
we tried the other places
but there's none we could reside
there's nothing quite like carnsies
on binghamton's east side
when carnsies caught on fire
good times went up in smoke
we lost the favorite meeting place
for common irish folk
the regulars were wishin'
for a place they could belong
with mickey yelling,""shut up!
this is a serious song!""  
right here we are a family
we've seen the worst and best
we celebrate, commiserate
and even welcome guests
but even heat and flames and smoke
can't keep our spirits down
there's nothing quite like carnsies
the best irish bar in town.   
now raise your glasses up with me
for this the final verse
will fill them to the brim
until the bottom bursts
come irish night on thursdays
and you'll never feel alone
so here's to our man billy
and to you say, ""welcome home!""  "

only for nights in ballygran

the deepest ocean
for my love to find
but the sea is wide and i cannot cross over
nor do i have any wings to fly
if i could find me a handsome boatman
to ferry me over to my love and die
my childhood days bring back sad reflections
of happy times i spent so long ago
my childhood friends and my relations
have all passed on now like the melting snow
so i'll spend my days in endless roving
soft is the grass, my bed is free
oh to be back now in carrickfergus
on that long road down by the sea
and in kilkenny, it is reported
there are marble stones there as black as ink
with gold and silver i would support her

a handsome rover from town to town
ah but i'm sick now, my days are numbered

Casey's Hat,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=415,"casey wore his brand new hat
to murphy's wake last night
someone stole his hat and, boy,
it started up a fight
casey smashed the furniture
the radio as well
he nearly woke the corpse up
as he began to yell
i had a hat when i came in
i hung it on the rack
and i'll have a hat when i go out
or i'll break somebody's back
i'm a peaceful loving man i am,
and i don't want to shout,
but i had a hat when i came in,
and i'll have a hat when i go out!
casey kept on fighting sure t
hey couldn't keep him quiet
someone phoned up for the cops
to come and stop the riot
two cops then rushed into the room,
but casey laid them out
as he threw them through the window,
they both heard casey shout
i had a hat...
casey kept on fighting
until one eyed paddy flynn
socked him on the whiskers
with a great big rolling pin
he knocked poor casey senseless,
it was an awful clout
as he lay there unconscious
casey kept on shouting out
i had a hat.."

Cavan Girl,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=2,"as i walk the road from kilashandra, weary eyes are down
for it's twelve long miles around the lake to get to cavan town
lough after on the road i go, one scene beyond compare
and i curse the time it takes to reach my cavan girl so fair
now the autumn shades are on the leave, the trees will soon be bare
each red hued leaf around me seems the color of her hair
my gaze retreats, defies my feet and once again i sigh
for each broken blue around seems the colour of her eyes
at the cavan cross each sunday morning, there she can be found
and it seems she has the eye of every boy in cavan town
if my luck will hold, i'll catch the golden summer of her smile
and i'll break the hearts of cavan men for she'll talk with me awhile
so next sunday evening finds me homeward, kilashandra bound
to work a week 'till i return to court in cavan town
when asked if she would be my wife at least she's not said no
so next sunday early, 'rouse myself, and back to her i'll go"

Champion at Drivin' Them Crazy,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=69,"melody: limerick rake
i am a bold irishman, murphy's me name.
i'm known as a piper and fiddler of fame.
tin whistlin's me forte, on the flute i'm the same
at the squeeze-box there's none can me equal.
i whistle for breakfast, and pipe for me tea
i play me ould flute twenty-five hours a day.
and i can't understand why so many folk say
i'm champion at drivin' 'em crazy.
well, i once had a sweetheart, so fair and divine
she said that she loved me, i thought she was mine.
she'd the shape of a fiddle and her hair was so fine
for bowstrings you'd sure find no better.
she told me forever her love would endure;
she asked me to kiss her, me answer was, "" sure.
and why not? it's good practice for my embouchure!""
i'm champion at drivin' 'em crazy.
well, this lass was persistent and her efforts soon led
to a room in a pub with a big double bed
and she said,"" do you know it is time we were wed? ""
i said, "" is that a reel or a hornpipe? ""
well i took off my clothes and down on the bed sat
says she, "" won't your whistle go longer than that?""
i said, ""what takes your fancy, is it f or b-flat? ""
i'm champion at drivin' 'em crazy.
well, a little while after, she says to me, ""pat,
i think that your whistlin' is making me fat.""
and, a few months being over, she up and begat
a wee fellow, the image of me.
well, at three weeks of age he could lilt a few tunes;
at a month he was batterin' on bodhran and bones.
and now he's the master of chanter and drones
he'll be champion at drivin' 'em crazy.
well me wife she soon left us, and all in due course
for ""musical cruelty"" she got her divorce,
and despite all our vows of ""for better or worse,""
i'm left all alone with the baby.
well, he's ireland's best piper by quite a long chalk;
his fiddling's unequaled from sligo to cork,
and, as soon as he learns how to walk and to talk
he'll be champion at drivin' 'em crazy"
Charley on the M.T.A,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=70,"let me tell you the story of a man named charley
on this tragic and fateful day
he put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
went to ride on the mta
did he ever return, no he never returned
and his fate is still unlearned
he may ride forever 'neath the streets of boston
he's the man who never returned.
charley handed in his dime at the kendall square station
and he changed for jamaica plain
when he got there the conductor told him, ""one more nickel.""
charley could not get off that train.
now all night long charley rides through the tunnels
saying, ""what will become of me?
how can i afford to see my sister in chelsea
or my cousin in roxbury?""
churl's wife goes down to the scollay square station
every day at quarter past two
and through the open window she hands charley a sandwich
as the train comes rumblin' through.
now did you ever wonder
why she never puts a nickle in his sandwich of cheese and ham?
well the woman has a secret
she wants charlie on that subway
'cause the woman has another man!
now you citizens of boston, don't you think it's a scandal
that the people have to pay and pay
vote for george o'brien and fight the fare increase
get poor charley off the mta
music: the ship that never returned; also the wreck of the old 97"
Charlie and the T.S.A.,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=488,"let me tell you the story
bout a man named charlie,
whos departing from jfk,
packed up all his belongings in his carry-on luggage,
all he wanted was to fly away.
 but will he ever depart?
no! hell never depart!
and hell never get onto that plane,
because a nose-hair clipper is a lethal weapon,
hes detained by the tsa
charlies loose shampoo and his roll-on deodrant
were a sight for the agent to see!
he even found some toothpaste and disposable razors,
says the agent, now youre coming with me!
charlie handed in his baggage for a gloved inspection
cuz his hygeine shouldnt be a crime,
all the agents gathered round him
like flies at a picnic saying
this is gonna take some time!
now homeland security went to def con 7
when they found his non-prescription drugs,
but they waved through akhmed
with his beard and turban
cuz they wouldnt want to profile thugs!
poor charlie was labled as a troublemaker
for leaving on his sneakers and belt,
so they stripped him and they searched him
and they frisked him and they dissed him,
but they didnt leave a blemish or welt.
now about this time, charlies flight was arriving
at the place where he needed to be,
while back in new york, charlies naked and shakin
saying, why did they do this to me?
now akhmed got out of the 747,
and he went off to work next day,
newspapers on the racks of his 7-11,
featured charlie and the tsa!"

Christmas in the Trenches,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=72,"my name is francis tolliver, i come from liverpool.
two years ago the war was waiting for me after school.
to belgium and to flanders, to germany to here
i fought for king and country i love dear.
'twas christmas in the trenches, where the frost so bitter hung,
the frozen fields of france were still, no christmas song was sung
our families back in england were toasting us that day
their brave and glorious lads so far away.
i was lying with my messmates on the cold and rocky ground
when o're the field of battle came a most peculiar sound
says i, ``now listen up, me boys!'' each soldier strained to hear
as one young german voice sang out so clear.
``he's singing bloody well, you know!'' my partner says to me
then one by one, each german voice joined in harmony
the cannons rested silent, the gas clouds rolled no more
as christmas brought us respite from the war
as soon as they were finished and a reverent pause was spent
``god rest ye merry, gentlemen'' struck up some lads from kent
the next they sang was ``stille nacht.'' ``tis `silent night','' says i
and in two tongues one song filled up that sky
``there's someone coming toward us!'' the front line sentry cried
all sights were fixed on one long figure trudging from their side
his truce flag, like a christmas star, shown on that plain so bright
as he, bravely, strode unarmed into the night
than one by one on either side walked into ""no man's land""
with neither gun nor bayonet we met there hand to hand
we shared some secret brandy and we wished each other well
and in a flare-lit soccer game we gave them hell
we traded chocolates, cigarettes, and photographs from home
these sons and fathers far away from families of their own
young sanders played the squeezebox and they had a violin
this curious and unlikely band of men
than daylight stole upon us and france was france once more
with sad farewells we each prepared to settle back to war
but the question haunted every heart that lived that wonderous night
``whose family have i fixed within my sights?''
'twas christmas in the trenches where the frost, so bitter hung
the frozen fields of france were warmed when songs of peace were sung
for the walls they'd built between us to exact their work of war
were crumbled and were gone forevermore
my name is francis tolliver, in liverpool i dwell
each christmas come since world war i, i've learned its lessons well
but the ones who call the shots won't be among the dead and lame
and on each end of the rifle we're the same"
City of Chicago,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=73,"in the city of chicago, where the evening shadows fall
there are people dreamin' of the hills of donegal
1847 was the year it all began
deadly pains of hunger drove a million from our land
they journyed not for glory, their mission wasn't greed
a journey for survival across the stromy sea  
some of them knew fortune and some of them knew fame
more of them knew hardship and died upon the plain
the rode throughout the nation, they rode the railroad cars
brought their songs and music, to ease their lonely hearts "

oh that clancy
oh that clancy
whenever they got his irish up
clancy lowered the boom
boom  boom boom boom
boom boom boom boom
clancy was a peaceful man
if you know what i mean
the cops picked up the pieces
after clancy left the scene
he never looked for trouble
that's a fact you can assume
but nevertheless
when trouble would press
clancy lowered the boom
clancy left the barbershop
with tonic in his hair
he walked into the pool room
and he met o'reilly there
o'raille says, ""for goodness sake
now do i smell perfume?""
before you could stack
your cue in the rack
clancy lowered the boom  
mulrooney walked into the bar
and ordered up a round
he left his drink to telephone
and clancy drunk it down
mulrooney say's, ""who drunk me drink?
i'll lay him in his tomb!""
before you could pat
the top of your hat
clancy lowered the boom 
o'hallahan delivered ice
to mrs. clancy's flat
he'd always linger for a while
and talk or this and that
one day he kissed her
just as clancy walked into the room
before you could say
the time of the day
clancy lowered the boom  
the neighborhood turned out
for kate o'grady's wedding night
murphy says, ""let's have some fun!
i tink i'll start a fight!""
he wrecked the hall and kissed the bride
and pulverized the groom
before you could fling
your arm in a sling
clancy lowered the boom 
* the are many variations"
Clancy's Wooden Wedding,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=76,"five years ago last sunday night when clancy took a wife
'twas little bridget haley who would stick to him for life
and he gave a wooden wedding the event to celebrate
and he sent out invitations to his friends both small and great
now everyone was supposed to bring a present made of wood
some of the things they brought were bad and some were very good
but everyone who came they did the very best they could
when clancy had a weddin' made of wood
there was all kinds of wood brought to the house that night
hard wood, soft wood and kindling wood delight
there was wood and wooden shavings enough to fill a bed
'twas brought to clancy's house when he was five years wed
now the first one to get there was tim o'hoolihan,
he brought for a present a japanese fan
then came maloney just as neat as a pin
he brought a cradle for to rock the baby in
o'brien brought a sawhorse handsomely engraved
o'toole brought a cord of wood for which he didn't pay
murphy brought the clothespins and ryan brought a broom
and it looked as though a lumberyard exploded in the room
wood that came from china, wood that came from spain
wood from jerusalem across the ragin' main
wood that came from russia sent by the csar
wood that came from ireland enought to build a car
wood that came from england, wood that came from wales
wood that came from scotland, wood that came from jails
they passed around the whiskey and they passed around the ale
and if the glasses wasn't big enough they used a wooden pail
everyone was feelin' good no one was feelin' dry
all around the glory and the glory it was high
someone asked clancy, ""would he sing a song?""
clancy said he would, but his voice was gone
up jumped maloney and he gave a recitation
all about the kind of wood that grew in every nation
""begorra  such a racket i can't keep it mum!""
o'brien called maloney an educated bum
well up jumped maloney and he gave him such a whack
it raised up a hump in the middle of his back
that was the signal and they all began to fight
and the women hollared, ""murder!"" and they said it wasn't right
murphy threw the poker and it hit o'hoolihan
o'brien threw the kettle and he threw the frying pan
patrick lost his false teeth and through the window dove
maloney sat down on a red hot stove
well there was all kinds of wood went flyin' through the air
brady hit o'grady with the round of a chair
murphy took sullivan and threw him on the bed
stabbed him with a clothespin and left him there for dead
police got twenty five and thirty got away
they took then up before the judge the very next day
the judge looked them over as before them they stood
he gave them sixty days in jail...now they're all sawing wood"

summer stars are in the sky
we'll get the ferry out from roonagh
and wave all our cares goodbye
and we'll go dancing at the ceili
we'll go kissing on the strand
take our clothes off in the moonlight
skinny-dipping hand in hand
and we'll start drinking in the twilight
keep it up until the dawn
in both the bars
because there's no guards
to take our names and send us home.
will you meet me on clare island
gettin' weary of the city
seems so many things have changed
let's head off for nora dalys home
where she's walked
it never rained
so will you meet me on clare island
and if there's wild and tall white horses
and the swell rolls in the bay
i won't care if the boat can't sail
sure we'll get home
some other day
so will you meet me on clare island."

with my pockets full of green. 
the only time i feel alright
is when i'm into drinking.
it can sort of ease the pain of it
and it levels out my thinking.  
i sometimes hear a fiddle play
or maybe it's a notion.
i dream i see white horses dance
upon that other ocean. "
Cliffs of Dooneen,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=78,"you may travel far far from your own native home
far away o'er the mountains, far a-way o'er the foam,
but of all the fine places that i've ever been
sure there's none can compare with the cliffs of doneen.
take a view o'er the mountains, fine sights you'll see there
you'll see the high rocky mountains o'er the west coast of clare
oh the town af kilkee and kilrush can be seen
from the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of doneen.
it's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day
watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay
oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen
making homes for their young round the cliffs of doneen.
fare thee well to doneen, fare thee well for a while
and to all the kind people i'm leaving behind
to the streams and the meadows where late i have been
and the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of doneen"
Cockles and Mussels  a.k.a. Molly Malone,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=79,"alive alive oh
alive alive ohh
singing cockles and mussels
alive alive ohhh
in dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty
i once met a girl named sweet molly malone
and she wheeled her wheel barrow
through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh
she was a fish monger
and sure was no wonder
so were her mother and father before
and they wheeled their wheel barrow
through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh
she died of a fever
and so one could save her
and that was the end of sweet molly malone
now her ghost wheels her barrow through the streets broad and narrow
singing cockles and mussels alive alive oh
she wheels her wheel barrrow
thought the streets broad and narrow
her barrow is narrow
her hipa are too wide
and whenever she wheels it
the neighborhood feels it
her girdle keeps brushin' the homes on each side
it's not just her fat but,
it's not only that but,
she's cockeyed and musclebound molly malone "
Color of your Smile O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=80,"angels spinning webs of gold
to make the fine strands of your hair
you feel the twilight shadows grow
but still there's summer in the air
i don't need to turn
the rainbow upsidedown
to catch the color of your smile
you must believe what lies inside
for i knew it all the while
love is carried on the wind
sometimes you feel the air is still
perhaps the strongest message sent
is masked by autumn's lonely chill
you must believe what lies inside
to show the color of your smile
deepest oceans, deepest skies
palates filled with shades of blue
reflect the colors of your eyes
refect the truth of what is you
i don't need to turn
the rainbow upsidedown
to catch the color of your smile
you must believe what lies inside
for i knew it all the while
candles flicker passion's flames
can't be doused in summer rains
my life will never be the same
and that's the beauty of your name
you must believe what lies inside
to show the color of your smile"
Come By the Hills,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=81,"come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
and stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done
oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song
and sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done
come by the hills to the land where legend re-mains
where stories of old fill the heart and may yet come a-gain
where our past has been lost and the future has still to be won
ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done

Come With Me Over the Mountain,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=419,"one night when the bright moon
was alumined in the sky
when i first took the notion to marry
i put on my hat and away i did high
you might think i was in a great hurry
when i came to a place where i often had been
oh my heart gave a leap when my darlin'
i seen i opened the door
and i bid her good night saying
will you come over the mountain?
oh what a sort of a foot has got into your head
i am glad for to meet you so merry
it's now 12 o'clock when you should be in bed
just speak low or you'll waken me mammy
if you think i am jesting my jesting is true
i have courted 12 month, faith i think
it should do and before i do go i'll be married to you
if you'll come with me over the mountain
if i was to make an elopement with you
it might well be attended with danger
the country would sensure and tattle us
to all my friends would all frown and no wonder
well now just let them sensure and tattle away
consult with yourself for it's very near day
and i don't give a pin what the whole of them say
if once you have over the mountain
now i am resolved now at home for to stay
i think it more fitting and better
then herd you well darlin i must now away
and so that puts an end to the matter
oh stop, stop for a moment till i get my shoes
oh me heart gave a leap when i heard the good news
she ran to the door saying maybe i'll choose
to elope with you over the mountain
by this time the moon had gone down in the west
and the morning star brightly was shining
we both made our way with the greatest of haste
for the wedding our two hearts were pining
and the servent came to us without more delay
sure he married us both on the very same day
and often we chat when we've little to say
of the trip we took over the mountain"
Coming Back To Milltown,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=85,"as i sit and dream in boston, beneath the starry sky
memories keep crowing of the times i was a boy
a barefoot tappy lad was i on the wide, wide streets of home
a carefree lad with friends galore, i was a fool to roam
and now i comin' back to milltown
in a week i will be there
back to the friends i loved so well
in my dear old county clare
i love the friends and neighbors
and i'll drink with all the boys
i long to see the sadness
leave my dear mother's eyes
now my mother she had raised me, on her own since i was three
and it nearly broke her kindly  heart when i sailed across the sea
but i was young in those far off days all i wanted was to roam
i didn't mind the sadness that i caused to those back home  
now in quilty there's a beauty, and her name it is eileen
i know that she'll be waiting, waiting there for me
so no more i'll go a rovin', in milltown i will stay
and i'll wed my dark eyed beauty, right  away  "
Confession,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=450,"a church it was busy with pew after pew
the faithful in mind to me shriven
down on their knees doing laps with their beads
that their sins be absoved and forgiven
and in the confessional father o'rorke
saw humanity stripped to the core
and a word with the boss made the sign of the cross
and admoninshed them, 'go sin no more!'
well after an hour of sin upon sin
and dollops of perfect contrition
the door clicked open and an old man walked in
and assumed the confession position
this old white haired fellow as old as the hills
90 if he was a day
his face wrinkled and creased
he looked up to the priest and said,
'father, i've something to say.'
'i'm a very old man,
i'll be 91 years on the next 14th day of november
&amp; all of my life i've been true to my wife
as far as i seem to remember
then a fit of great madness 3 nites ago
god knows what i thought i was doin'
i slept with 2 teenage lasses at once
and brought them both to conclusion'
then father o'rorke didn't know what to say
but the old man had made an impression
his voice level and calm as he looked at the man
and said, 'when were you last at confession?'
'it's my very 1st time,' the old man replied.
'i've not been to confession before.
i've been a protestant all of my life.
at least till i walked thru that door.'
now father o'rorke was a great deal confused
he said, 'now there's something amiss!
if you've been a protestant all of your life t
hen why are you tellin' me this?'
the old man just beamed
a broad wicked glear
in the darkness his little eyes glistened
'oh father,' he said with a voice full of glee
'i'm tellin' anybody who'll listen!'"
County of Armagh,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=86,"there's one fair county in ireland
with mem'ries so glorious and grand
where nature has lavished its bounty
it's the orchard of erin's green land
i love her cathedrals and cities
once founded by patrick so true
and it holds in the heart of its bossom
the ashes of brian boru
it's my dear irish home, far across the foam
although i've often left her in foreign lands to roam
no matter where i wander in cities near or far
sure my heart belongs in old ireland
in the county of armagh
i've wandered a part of the county
through newtown, forkhill, crossmaglen
around by the gap of mount morris
and back by black water again
where the girls are so gay and so hearty
the finest in erin go bragh
ah but where are the boys who will court them
the boys from the county armagh  "
Courtin' in the Kitchen,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=87,"come single belle and beau unto me pay attention
don't ever fall in love it's the devil's own invention
for once i fell in love with a maiden do bewitchin'
miss henrietta bell down in captain kelly's kitchen
singin' too ra loo ra la
singin' too ra loo ra laddie
singin' too ra loo ra la
singin' too ra loo ra laddie
at the age of seventten i was 'prenticed by a grocer
down on stven's green where miss henry used to go sit
her manners were sublime she set my heart a twitchin'
then she invited me to a hooley in the kitchen  
now sunday being the day we were to have the flare up
i dressed myself quite gay and i frizzed and oiled my hair up
the captain had no wife and he'd gone off a fishin'
so we kicked up high life below stairs in the kitchen 
just as the clock struck six we sat down at the table
she handed cakes and tay and i ate what i was able
i had cakes and punch and tay and me sides they got a stitch in
and the time passed quick away with our courtin in the kitchen 
with my arms around her waist she shyly hinted marriage
when to the door in dreadful haste came captain kelly's carriage
her looks told me full well and they were not bewitchin'
that she's wish i go to hell, or somewhere from that kitchen 
she flew up off my knee a full five feet or higher
and over head and heels through me slap into the fire
my new repealer's coat that i bought from mr. mitchell
and a twenty shilling note went to blazes in the kitchen  
i grieved to see me duds all besmeared with smoke and ashes
when a tub of dirty suds right in me face she dashes
as i lay on the floor the water she kept pitchin'
'till a footman broke the door and came chargin' in the kitchen 
when the captian came downstair though he'd seen me situation
depite all of me prayers of was marched off to the station
for me they's take no bail though to get home i was itchin'
still i had to tell the tale how i wound up in that kitchen  
i said she did invite me but she gave a flat denial
for assult she did indict me and i was sent to trial
she swore i'd robbed the house in spite of all her screechin'
and i got six months hard for my courtin' in the kitchen"
Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=88,"weren't we the rare oul' stock? spent the evenin' gettin' locked
in the ace of hearts where the high stools were engaging,
over the butt bridge, down by the dock
the boat she sailed at five o'clock
""hurry, boys,"" said whack, or before we're there we'll all be back
carry him if you can  the crack was ninety in the isle of man.
before we reached the alexander base; the ding dong we did surely raise
in the bar of the ship we had great sport, as the boat she sailed out of  the port
landed up in the douglas head enquired for a vacant bed.
the dining room we soon got shown by a decent woman up the road.
'lads, ate it if you can, the crack was ninety in the isle of man.
next morning we went for a ramble round; viewed the sights of douglas town
then we went tor a mighty session, in a pub they call dick darby's.
we must have been drunk by half-past three; to sober up we went swimmin' in the sea
back to the digs for the spruce up, and while waitin' for the fry
we all drew up our plan; the crack was ninety in the isle of man.
that night we went to the texas bar; came back down by horse and car.
met big jim and all went in to drink some wine in yate's.
the liverpool judies, it was said, were all to be found in the douglas head
mcshane was there in his suit and shirt, them foreign girls he was tryin' to flirt
sayin' ""here girls, i'm your man,"" the crack was ninety in the isle of man.
whacker fancied his good looks; on an isle of man woman he was struck.
but a liverpool lad was by her side. and he throwin'the jar into her.'
whacker thought he'd take a chance; he asked the quare one out to dance.
around the floor they stepped it out, and to whack it was no bother.
everythin' was goin' to plan; the crack was ninety in the isle of man.
the isle of man woman fancied whack; your man stood there till his mates came back
whack! they all whacked into whack, and whack was whacked out on his back.
the police force arrived as well, banjoed a couple of them as well,
landed up in the douglas jail, until the dublin boat did sail,
deported every man, the crack was ninety in the isle of man."

well children children bring up the looking glass
and come and see the crayfish that bit your mother's ear

well she yelled and she screamed the noise it shook the walls
and then to get me back she grabbed me by the beard
well she swung and she hit me really cleaned my clock
but i never once fell over cause she grabbed me by the collar

Crescent Moon O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=89,"i'll hang my hat, on the crescent moon
and we'll dance, dance, dance
while the heavens play our tune
upon the stars, i'll count your charms
and we'll dance, dance, dance
till we are snuggling in each others arms
let's dance, and sing
effected by the altitude of our nocturnal fling
it's, a magic thing
and i am growing dizzy knowing what the night will bring
we are high above the rooftops as we dance and twirl
and far below we see the lights upon the world
we'll waltz, and sway
acting out out parts, in our midnight play
you sweep me, away
gliding on the starlight or each newborn moonlight ray
i could only wish the night would last forevermore
as we grow ever closer to heaven's door
let's enjoy, this precious time
having you here with me must be nature's own design
having you, as mine
heaven's intervention, truly was divine
your the only reason in the world that i would say
i wish it could, be night each day
we'll waltz and swing, all night
and create a new sensation amidst the constellations
we don't mind the heights
and then we'll show the nations, our own interpretations
as we're gliding like a feather on the winds that rule above
the world will know that we're in love"

and in dungannon where his body lies
so all good people who do pass by
do drop a tear for the croppy boy"

danny boy is the story of a father who has 4 boys. the eldest 3 have all gone
off to war and been killed. now the youngest, danny all of 16 years old is old enough to go to war himself (the pipes, the pipes of war are calling him). his father knows the odds and realizes that danny too will probably be a casualty. in the event danny lives however, the father knows he's so old and broken hearted at the prospects of losing all his sons that he will die of a broken heart. this is his farewell song to his youngest son."
Days of Yore,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=93,"i wandered in time, till i found myself thinking
of young children playing at the dawning of spring
they sang merry tunes like ""the wind in the willow""

the days that we spent in a boat with outrfather
too young for to help at a very young age
watching with care as they worked on the water
those mem'ries still linger of warm summer days
and then sunday morning, we'd walk to the chapel
to count up our blessing for all we received
and give thanks to the lord for good heath and well being
in return for our living and what we believed
and when we returned we would join in a session
and enjoy all the tunes and songs that we shared
and our mother would call us to come to the kitchen
to eat at the table that she had prepared
those days are long gone, but the'll ne're be forgotten
those mem'ries still linger and fill me with joy
those days are long gone, but they'll ne're be forgotten

the lads all decked in corduroy the colleens wearing green
there'll be thousands there i've never seen
i've been so long away,

Devil Went Down to Glasgow,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=546,"the devil went down to glasgow,
he was looking for a jig or reel
he knew a pipers spell could send you to hell

when he came across a braw wee lad
squeezing a bag and blowin it hot

and said, ""braccchhhhchhooocccchhhh""

but i'm a piper too
when my pipes get snorin twill stirrr your sporan
and will shrink yer digerido

but when i play the pipes im wesley snipes
and i drone like a doberman pincer
heres a game to keep your pipes
thatll be your just       reward--- and then
the loser gets the eternal prize
of playing the accordion
kevins blowin up his bag, hes ready for the bet
you just know when he starts piping, his brow is bathed in sweat
his tighty whities would keep up,  the bet they could sustain
be sure the craic was mighty, it was coming down like rain
instrumental
the devil cursed and closed up his case
his face was cloked in pain
he said hand me that accordion
ill give you lady of spain
youve schooled me with yer pipin
my face is flushed with shame
i canny bring ye doon  to hell
because your sweat would douse the flames

as a piper youre pathetic
you can practice more you sob

did your mother come from ireland
for there's something in you irish
and that bit of irish steals my heart away"
Dirty Ould Town,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=98,"i met my love in a gas works croft
dreamed a dream, by the old canal
kissed my girl by the fac'try wall
dirty ould town, dirty ould town
i saw the clouds drift across the moon
cats are crawling, all along the beat
springs a girl to the streets at night
dirty ould town, dirty ould town
i heard a siren, down by the docks
saw a train, set the night on fire
i smelled the spring on a smokey breeze
dirty ould town, dirty ould town
i'm gonna get me, a good sharp ax
shinin' steel tempered in a fire
we'll chop you down, like a dead ould tree
dirty ould town, dirty ould town"
Donald Where's Yer Trousers?,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=99,"i just got in from the isle of skye
i'm not very big and i'm awfully shy
the ladies shout as i go by--
donald where's your trousers.
let the winds blow high,
let the winds blow low,
down the street in my kilt i go
and all the ladies say hello
donald where's your trousers
a lady took me to a ball
and it was slippery in the hall
i was afraid that i would fall
'cause i didn't have on my trousers  
they'd like to wed me everyone
just let them catch me if they can --
you canna put the brakes on a highland man
who doesn't like wearing trousers. 
to wear the kilt is my delight,
it isn't wrong, i know it's right.
the highlanders would get afright
if they saw me in trousers. 
well i caught a cold and me nose was raw
i had no handkerchief at all
so i hiked up my kilt and i gave it a blow,
now you can't do that with trousers. "
Donegal Danny,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=100,"i remember the night that he came in
from the wintery cold and damp
a giant of a man in an oilskin coat
and a bundle that told he was a tramp
he stood at the bar and he called a pint
then turned and gazed at the fire
on a night like this, to be safe and dry
is my one and only desire
so here's to those that are dead and gone
the friends that i loved dear
and here's to you then i'll bid you adieu
sayin' ""donegal danny's been here, me boys""
donegal danny's been here
then in a voice that was hushed and low
he said ""listen, i'll tell you a tale""
how a man of the sea became a man of the road
and never more will set sail
i fished out of howth and killybegs,
ardglass and baltimore
but the cruel sea has beaten me
and i'll end my days on the shore
one fateful night in the wind and the rain
we set sail from killybegs town
there were five of us from sweet donegal
and one from county down
we were fishermen who worked the sea
and never counted the cost
but i never thought 'ere that night was gone
that my fine friends would all be lost
then the storm it broke and broke the boat
with the rocks about ten miles from shore
as we fought the tide, we hoped inside
to see our homes once more
then we struck a rock and holed the bow
and all of us knew that she'd go down
so we jumped right into the icy sea
and prayed to god we wouldn't drown
but the ragin' sea was risin' yet
as we struck out for the land
and she fought with all her cruelty
to claim that gallant band
by saint john's point in the early dawn
i dragged myself on the shore
and i cursed the sea for what she'd done
and vowed to sail her never more
ever since that night i've been on the road
travelin' and trying to forget
that awful night i lost all my friends
i see their faces yet
and often at night when the sea is high
and the rain is tearing at my skin
i hear the cries of drowning men
floating over on the wind"
Down By the Glenside,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=420,"'twas down by the glenside
i met an old woman
a pluckin' young nettles
she ne'er saw me comin'
i listened a while t
o the song she was hummin'
glory-o, glory o to the bold fenian men
when i was a young girl
their marchin &amp; drillin
awoke in the glen sound
awesome &amp; thrillin
they loved poor old ireland
&amp; to die they were willin
glory-o, glory o to the bold fenian men
it's 50 long years
since i saw the moon beamin
on strong manly forms
&amp; on eyes with hope gleamin
sure i seen them again
through all my day dreamin
glory-o, glory o to the bold fenian men
i passed on my way
god be praised that i met her
be life long or short sure
i'll never forget her
we may have great men
but we'll never have better
glory-o, glory o to the bold fenian men"
Dream With Open Eyes,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=551,"i wrote a song it was new to me
then heard the words and the melody
then i knew id sung this song before
about a life that i once knew
with many years where dreams came true
than i awoke and dreams would last no more
then i prayed for sleep to come
another dream to be the one
to last the hours long past the morning sun
it brightly shone to light the day
it said my dreams could never stay
until that time when light would steal away
darkness fell and when i closed my eyes
stars and planets dimly lit the skies
wait for sleep to come and i wondered when
....will i ever dream again
passions flames were slowly doused
smoke was rising through my house
that sound alarms to open every door
waken now and run away
promises of better days
as billowed clouds try shielding whats in store
clearing skies of what can be
friends who came to rescue me
bearing gifts were true and not contrived
blinded by a beautys stare
it seemed the dark was always there
teaching me to dream with open eyes
darkness fell and when i closed my eyes
stars and planets dimly lit the skies
wait for sleep to come and i knew right then
.... i can always ever dream again"
Drink With Joy   a.k.a.  Preab San Ol,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=101,"those in this game for fortune and fame
might spare a thought for how short is life
what will it matter midst all this clatter
when you're six feet down without child or wife
what e're your thing duke, lord or king
you'll not take a h'penny into the ground
forget your troubles they're only life's bubbles
and cry let's fill up with one more round
the covetous banker for profits may hanker
but for him the gaining is only a game
it's not that he's needy he's just being greedy
and the profits he makes are just profits in name
for the greatest of prophets such methods would scoff at
as camels who'd pass through a needles eye found
so forget all your troubles they're only life's bubbles
and call for the filling of one more round
the captain at sea can never feel free
tho in harbors all over the world he may hide
from spain to gibralter or anchored in malta
or far constantinople on the world's otherside
for he must set to sea and tis then he will see
that death can be mastered in strom or aground
so forget all your troubles they're only life's bubbles
and call for the filling of one more round
the life of a flower is shed by the hour
and brighter the lilly the quicker will fade
yet solomon's glory tho fabled in story
could ne'er be so brightly or briefly arrayed
the life with his sins is a puff of the winds
a brief wisp of mist on a hillside around
so forget all your troubles they're only life's bubbles
and call for the filling of one more round"
Drunk Last Night and Sixpence,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=102,"drunk last night (shout drunk the night before)

that ever came over, across the bloody sea

Drunken Lullabies,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=572,"must it take a life for hateful eyes
to glisten once again
five hundred years like gelignite
have blown us all to hell
what savior rests while on his cross we die
while forgotten freedom burns
has the shepard led his lambs astray
to the bigot and the gun
must it take a life for hateful eyes
to glisten once again
'cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
singin' drunken lullabies
i watch and stare as rosin's eyes
turn a darker shade of red
and the bullet with this sniper lie
in their bloody gutless cell
must we starve on crumbs from long ago
through bars these men made steel
is it a great or little thing we fought
knelt the conscience blessed to kill
must it take a life for hateful eyes
to glisten once again
'cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
singin' drunken lullabies
ah, but maybe it's the way you were taught
or maybe it's the way we fought
but a smile never grins without tears to begin
for each kiss is a cry we all lost
though there is nothing left to gain
but for the banshee that stole the grave
'cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
singin' drunken lullabies
i sit in and dwell on faces past
like memories seem to fade
no color left but black and white
and soon will all turn grey
but may these shadows rise to walk again
with lessons truly learnt
when the blossom flowers in each our hearts
shall beat a new found flame
must it take a life for hateful eyes
to glisten once again
'cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
singin' drunken lullabies
'cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
singin' drunken lullabies, singin' drunken lullabies"

Dublin Fusiliers,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=104,"well you've heard about the indians with their tommyhawks and spears
and of the u.n. warriors the heroes of recent years
also i might mention the british grenadiers
well none of them were in it but the dublin fusiliers.
you've heard about the light brigade and of the deeds they've done,
and of the other regiments that many vic'tries won
but the pride of all the armies dragoons and carabiniers
was that noble band of warriors the dublin fusiliers.
with your left foot and right about face this is the way we go
charging with fixed bayonets the terror of every foe.
a glory to old ireland as proud as buccaneers
and a terror to creation are the dublin fusiliers.
well you've heard about the wars between the russians and the brits.
the sar' one day was reading an old copy of """"titbits""""
and when the general came to him and threw himself down in tears
'we'd better run back like blazes, here's the dublin fusiliers.'
the sar' commenced to tremble and he bit his underlip..
begorra boys, says he, i think we better take the tip
the devil's come from dublin and to judge from what i hears
they're demons of militia men, the dublin fusiliers.
well the sergeant cried, 'get ready lads, lay down each sword and gun,
take off you shoes and stockings boys, and when i tell youse, run.
they didn't stop but started and amidst three ringing cheers,
came a shower of bricks and bullets from the dublin fusiliers.
the time that julius caesar tried to land down at ringsend
the coastguards couldn't stop them, so for the dublins they did send,
and, just as they were landing, lads, we heard three ringing cheers:
'get back to rome like blazes here's the dublin fusiliers."
Dublin in the Rare Ould Times,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=105,"raised on songs &amp; stories heroes of renown
the passing tales &amp; glories that once was dublin town
the hallowed halls and houses the haunting children's rhymes
that once was dublin city in the rare ould times.
ring a ring a rosey
as the light declines
i'll remember dublin city
in the rare ould times.
my name it is sean dempsey
as dublin as could be
born hard &amp; late in pimlico
in a house that ceased to be
by trade i was a cooper
lost out to redundancy
like my house that fell to progress
my trade's a memory
i courted peggy dignan
as pretty as you please.
a rogue and child of mary from the rebel liberties
i lost her to a student chap
with skin as back as coal
when he took her off to birmingham
she took away my soul. 
the years have made me bitter
the gargle dims my brain
'cause dublin keeps on changing
and nothing seems the same.
the pillar and the met have gone
the royal long since pulled down
as the grey unyielding concrete
makes a city of my town.
fare thee well sweet anna liffy
i can no longer stay
and watch me new glass cages
that spring up along me ouay
my mind's too full of memories
too old to hear new chimes
l'm a part of what was dublin
in the rare ould times."
Dublin Saunter,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=466,"i've been north and i've been south.
i've been rast and west.
i've been just a rolling stone,
yet there's one place on this earth
i've always liked the best,
just a little town i call my own.
for dublin can be heaven
with coffee at eleven
and a stroll in stephen's green.
there's no need to hurry.
there's no need to worry.
you're a king and the lady's a queen.
grafton street's a wonderland.
there's magic in the air.
there's diamonds in the lady's eyes,
and gold dust in her hair,
and if you don't believe me,
come and meet me there,
in dublin on a sunny summer morning.
i've been here and i've been there.
i've sought the rainbow's end,
but no crock of gold i've found.
now i know that, come what will,
whatever fate may send,
here my roots are deep in friendly ground.
for dublin can be heaven with coffee at eleven,
and a stroll in stephen's green.
there's no need to hurry.
there's no need to worry.
you're the king and the lady's a queen.
grafton street's a wonderland.
there's magic in the air.
there's diamonds in the lady's eyes
and gold dust in her hair,
and if you don't believe me,
come and meet me there,
in dublin on a sunny summer morning.
and if you don't believe me,
come and meet me there,
in dublin on a sunny summer morning.
this song was made famous by irish actor noel purcell. the here version is as sung by paddy reilly. it's also known as 'dublin can be heaven'."
Dublin Town in 1962,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=399,"me kids said dad, just tell us one more time
about when you were young and in your prime
and the way that you met ma, all the things you saw
tell us about the things you used to do
well i closed my eye and rolled the years away
everything's the same as yesterday
how could i forget the summer when we met
in dublin town in 1962.
all the days were sunny, all the skies were blue
in dublin town in 1962.
oh we climbed the hill of howth and down again
we walked home from the pillar in the rain
we courted in the park we're the lights glow in the dark
we danced in clery's and the metropol to two
we crossed the ha'penny bridge at evening tide
it felt so good to have you by my side
we watched the mailboats sail
paperboys cried herald or mail
in dublin town in 1962.
like many more we kissed it all goodbye
we sailed away to give our luck a try
in the land across the sea that's been good to you and me
where our children played like we once used to do
me kids said da that's really quite a tale
we know you have the spirit of the gael
and we have no regrets we're very glad you met
in dublin town in 1962."
Dutchman (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=106,"the dutchman's not the kind of man to keep his thumb jammed in the dam
that hold his dreams in
but that's a secret only margaret knows
when amsterdam is golden in the morning marget brings him breakfast
she believes him
he thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow
he's mad as he can be, but margaret only see that sometimes
sometimes she shes her unborn children in his eyes
let us go to the banks of the ocean
where the wall rise above the zeider zee
long ago, i used to be a young man
but dear margaret remembers that for me
the dutchman still wears wooded shoes
his cap and coat are patched with love that margaret sewn in
sometimes he thinks he's still in rotterdam
he watches tugboats down canals
and calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain
'till margaret comes to take him home again
through unforgiving streets that trip him though she holds his arm
sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name  
the windmills whirl the winter in, she winds his muffler tighter
they sit in the kitchen
some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew
he sees her for a moment, calls her name, she makes his bed up
singing some ould love somg
she learned it when the tune was very new
he hums a line or two, they hum together in the night
the dutchman falls asleep and margater blows the candle out"
Easy and Slow,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=107,"it was down by christ church where i first met with annie
a sweet gentle maiden and not a bit shy
she told me her father who came from dungannon
would take her back home in the sweet bye and bye
and what's it to any man whether or no
whether i'm easy or whether i'm slow
as i lifted her petticoat aisy and slow
and i rolled up my sleeve for to buckle her shoe
along by thomas street down by the liffy
the sun it was settin' as evening grew dark
along by kingsbridge and begod in a jiffy
my arms were around her beyond in the park  
from city to country a girl is a jewel
and well made for grippin' as most of them are
but any young man would be such a fool
if he tries on the first time to go a bit far  
so if ever you go to the town of dungannon
you can search till your eyeballs grow weary or blind
be you sittin' or walking or running or standin'
a girl like my annie you never will find    "

she looked up at me then she cried
without any warning
'the top of the morning'
and then up to her i replied
come, come, beautiful eileen,
come for a drive with me
over the mountain, down by the fountain
over the high road and down by the low road
make up your mind, don't be unkind
and we'll drive to castlebar

so just come along in my old jaunting car

don't think it ungrateful of me

when you first took my hand  on a cold christmas eve
you promised me broadway was waiting for me
you were handsome you were pretty queen of new york city
when the band finished playing they howled out for more
sinatra was swinging, all the drunks they were singing
we kissed on the corner then danced through the night
the boys of the nypd choir were singing 'galway bay'
and the bells were ringing  out for christmas day
you're a bum you're a punk you're an old slut on junk
lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
you scum bag you maggot you cheap lousy faggot
happy christmas you arse i pray god it's our last
i could have been someone so could anyone
you took my dreams from me when i first found you
i kept them with me babe i put them with my own
can't make it all alone i've built my dreams around you"

that i hated all others

with her maids and bridemaidens
she made a fine show
and i followed on
with my heart full of woe
for she's to be wed to another

well i sat down beside her
i poured out her wine
and i drank to the girl that should have been mine
but she was now wed to another

how many strawberries
grow in the salt sea
and i ask it them back
with a tear in my eye
how many ships sail in the forest

and cover it over
with flowers so sweet
and close my poor eyelids
forever in sleep
and maybe in death i'll forget her"

no rest for me

their arms are folded on their chest

Farthewell Enniskillen,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=111,"our troop was made ready at the dawn of the day
from lovely enniskillen they were marching us away.
they boarded us on board a ship to cross the raging main,
to fight in bloody battle in the sunny land of spain.
fare thee well enniskillen, fare thee well for a while
and all around the borders of erin's green isle;
and when the war is over we'll return in full bloom
and you'll all welcome home your enniskillen dragoons.
oh spain it is a gallant land where wine and ale flow free
there's plenty of lovely women there to dangle on your knee
and often in a tavern there we'd make the rafters ring
when every soldier in the house would raise his glass and sing   
well we fought for ireland's glory there and many a man had fallen
from musket and from bayonet and from thundering cannon ball
and many a poorman he laid low, amidst the battleground
and as we prepared for action you would often hear this sound  
.
well now the fighting's over and for home we have set sail,
our flag above this loyal ship is fluttering in the gale:
they've given us a pension boys of fourpence each a day
and when we reach enniskillen we'll never have to say."

Fiddler's Green,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=113,"as i went by the dockside one evening so fair
to view the still water and take the salt air

wrap me up in me oilskin and jumper
no more on the docks i'll be seen
just tell me old shipmates
i'm taking a trip, mates
and i'll see you one day in fiddler's green
now fiddler's green is a place i've heard tell
where fishermen go when they don't go to hell
where the skies are all clear and the dolphins do play
and the cold coast of greenland is far, far away
where there's always a breeze and there's never a gale
and the fish jump on board with a swish in their tail
and you lie at your leisure, there's nothing to do
and the captain's below making tea for the crew
when you get to the dock and the long trip is through
there's pubs and there's clubs, and there's lassies there too
and the girls are all pretty and the beer it is free
and there's bottles of rum growing from every tree
i don't need a harp or a halo, not me
just give me a breeze and a stiff rolling sea
and i'll play me old squeeze box as we roll along
when the wind in the rigging will sing me this song"

now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.""
low lie the fields of athenry
where once we watched the small free birds fly
our love was on the wing
we had dreams and songs to sing
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry.
by a lonely prison wall, i heard a young man calling
""nothing matters, mary, when you're free
against the famine and the crown,
i rebelled, they cut me down.
now you must raise our child with dignity.""  
by a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star fall
as the prison ship sailed out against the sky
sure she'll wait and hope and pray for her love in botany bay
it's so lonely round the fields of athenry.   "
Final Curtain,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=557,"when the final curtain comes down
will you simply end your part
or try to stick around
will you realize there are other parts to play
or linger on that stage for your final bow
and the reviews, will you worry what they say
by seeking put their every accolade
will you worry that their notions
say you just went through the motions
by assuming you would act for another day
will you argue that your role was based on how it was scripted
will you memory recall only the times you were uplifted
did you act out all your pain for a chance to win acclaim
did you use the tools at birth that you were gifted
bridge
now your play has ended
the run was not extended
and you realized your costume's only rented"
Finnegan's Wake,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=115,"tim finnegan lived on walken street
a gentle irishman tho mighty odd
he'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweat
and to rise in the world he carried a hod
but tim had a sort of a tippling' way
with the love of the liquor tim was born
and to help him on his way each day
he'd a drop of the crather every morn
whack for the hurrra dance your partner
round the floor ye trotters shake
isn't it the truth i tell you
lots of fun at finegan's wake
one day when tim was rather full
his head felt heavy which made him shake
he fell off a ladder and broke his skull
and they carried him off a corpse to wake
they carried him off in a nice clean sheet
and laid him out upon the bed
with a gallon of porter by his feet
and a noggin' of whiskey by his head  
his friends assembled at the wake
and mrs. finegan call for lunch (lunch!)
first they brought out tay and cakes
and pipes and tobacco and whiskey punch (punch!)
then biddy o'brien began to cry
""such a lovely corpse have you ever seen""
oh tim avoreen why did you did?""
""oh shut your gob!"", said biddy mcgee  
then peggy o'connor took up the job
""oh biddy"" she said, ""you're wrong i'm sure!""
biddy gave her a belt in the gob
and sent her sprawling opon on floor
each side in a war soon did engage
was woman to woman and man to man
shillelagh law was all the rage
and a row and a ruction soon began  
then mickey maloney ducked his head
when a noggin' of whiskey flew at him
it missed and landed on the bed
and the whiskey splattered all over tim
""begad! he revives! see how he rises!""
tim avoreen leaping from the bed
running all around like blazes
""thunderin' blazes! you think i'm dead?""  "
Finnigan's Ball,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=509,"michael finnigan held a ball
it was down in ballymahon in the old town hall
we drove in cabs to the festive scene
i hired a couple but i ran between
oh what a gathering we had there
oh what a gathering i declare
patsy sullivan he looked a wreck
for he had a gathering upon his neck
finnigan's ball what a night of jollity
finnigan's ball dancing all around
we were strict tea totelers one an all
till the cork came out at finnigan's ball.
old mrs mullin's three score and ten
hadn't had a kiss since the lord knows when
she bought a mask and went to the dance
to cover up her face it was her only chance
sat out a dance with mike muldoon
out upon the stairs she began to spoon
he spotted her face when he gave her a kiss
and said heaven help a sailor on a night like this
finnigan's ball there was michael cassidy
finnigan's ball playing in the band
for he was so thin and lean and small t
hat he fell through his trumpet at finnigan's ball
we had supper with lots to eat
say we had the finest whisky neat
there was trouble in store for us all oh dear
barney flynn drank finnigan's beer
mrs. bull had some appetite
she ate twenty seven buns that night
the buns are fine says mrs. bull
but i couldn't eat another
for my program's full
finnigan's ball little mrs. rafferty
finnigan's ball promised me a dance
but she slipped on the stairs and had a fall
and she broke her promise at finnegan's ball.
pat o'reilly and bridget bright
sat in an alcove out of sight
what an alcove is i couldn't swear
but whatever it is they both sat there
there they were necking till poor old pat
found she was sitting on his new hat
do you know what your sitting on miss says he
i oughta for i sat on it for years says she.
finnigan's ball there was mrs. branigan
finnigan's ball her dress is rather tight
for she stooped to tie her shoe that's all
but she never reversed at finnigan's ball."
Flight of Earls,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=116,"i can hear the bells of dublin
in this lonely waiting room
and the paperboys are singin'
in the rain
not too long before they take us
to the airport and the noise
to get on board
a transatlantic plane
we've got nothin' left to stay for,
we had no more left to say
and there isn't any work for us to do
so farewell ye boys and girls;
another bloody flight of earls
our best asset is our best export, too....
it's not murder, fear or famine
that makes us leave this time
we're not going to join
mcalpine's fusileers
we've got brains, and we've got visions; we've got education, too!
but we just can't throw away
these precious years
so we walk the streets of london,
and the streets of baltimore
and we meet at night
in several boston bars
we're the leaders of the future
but we're far away from home
and we dream of you
beneath the irish stars
as we look on ellis island,
and the lady in the bay
and manhattan turns to face
another sunday
we just wonder what you're doing
to bring us all back home
as we look forward to another monday
because it's not the work
that scares us
we don't mind an honest job
and we know things will get better
once again
so a thousand times adieu,
we've got bono and u2
all we're missin'
is the guinness, and the rain
so switch off your new computers
cause the writing's on the wall
we're leaving as our fathers did before
take a look at dublin airport, or the boat that leaves north wall
there'll be no youth unemployment
any more
because we're over here in queensland,
and in parts of new south wales
we're on the seas and airways
and the trains
but if we see better days,
those big airplanes go both ways
and we'll all be comin' back to you again!"

which those so dearly held

Flower of Sweet Straband,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=117,"if i were king of ireland's isle and had all things at my will
i'd roam for recreation and i'd seek for comfort still
but the fortune i would seek the most, you all might understand
is to win the heart of martha, the flower of sweet straband
her cheeks they are a rosy red, her hair a golden brown
and o'er her lilly white shoulders it carelessly flows down
she is one the loveliest creatures in the whole creation planned
and my heart is captivated by the flower of sweet straband
if i had you lovely martha away in innisown
of in some lovely valley in the wild woods of tyrone
i work my whole endeavor and i'd seek to work my plan
for my heart is captivated by the flower of sweet straband
oh now i'll go o're the lagan down by the steamships tall
for now i'm bound for amerikay across the briny foam
my ship is bound for liverpool down by the isle of mann
so i'll say farewell and god bless you my flower of sweet straband
well i've been in the phoenix park and in killarney fair
the lovely glens of antrim and the winding banks of clare
in all my earthly travels i never yet met one
that could compare, i do declare, with the flower of sweet straband
but since i cannot gain her love, no joy there is for me
and i must seek forgetfulness in lands across the sea
unless she cares to follow me, i swear by my right hand
mckenna's face you'll ne'er more see, my flower of sweet straband
so its farewell to sweet derry quay, new mills and waterside
i'll sail out o'er the ocean, whatever may betide
i'll sail away from derry quay out by the isle of man

Foggy Dew (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=118,"as down the glen one easter morn
to a city fair rode i.
there armoured lines of marching men
in squadrons passed me by.
no pipe did hum, no battle drum
did sound its loud tattoo
but the angelus bell o'er the liffy's swell
rang out in the foggy dew.
right proudly high over dublin town
they hung out that flag of war.
'twas better to die 'neath an irish sky
than at suvla or sud el bar.
and from the plains of royal meath
strong men came hurrying through;
while brittania's sons with their long-range guns
sailed in from the foggy dew.
oh the night fell black and the rifle's crack
made perfidious albion reel
mid the leaded rail seven tongues of flame
did shine o're the lines of steel
by each shining blade a prayer was said
that to ireland her sons be true
when the morning broke still the war flag shook
out its fold on the foggy dew
it was england bade our wild geese go
that small nations might be free.
their lonely graves are by suvla's waves
on the fringe of the grey north sea.
but had they died by pearse's side
or fought with cathal bruagh,
their graves we'd keep where the fenians sleep
'neath the shroud of the foggy dew.
but the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
rang mournfully and clear
for those who died that eastertide
in the springing of the year.
and the world did gaze in deep amaze
at those fearless men and true
who bore the fight that freedom's light
might shine through the foggy dew.
then back through that glen i rode again
and my heart with grief was sore
for i parted then with valiant men
whom i never shall see more
and back to and fro in dreams i'll go
and i'll kneel and pray for you
oh slavery fled oh glorious dead
when you fell in the foggy dew"
Foggy Foggy Dew (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=119,"now i am a bachelor i live all alone
i work at the weaver's trade
and the only only thing that i ever did wrong
was to woo a fair maid
i wooed her in the summertime and most of the winter too
and the only only thing that i ever did wrong
was to save her from the foggy foggy dew
one night she crept into my bed
when i lay fast asleep
she threw her arms around my neck
and then began to weep
she sighed, she cried, she damn near died
and what was i to do?
just to save her from the foggy foggy dew
now i am a bachelor i live with my son
and we work at the weaver's trade
and every every time that i look into his eyes
he reminds me of that fair young maid
he reminds me of that summertime
and most of the winter too
and the many many times that i held her in my arms
just to save her from the foggy foggy dew"
Follow me up to Carlow,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=120,"lift maccahir og your face brooding o'er the old disgrace

until he met at glenmalure with feach machugh o'byrne.
curse and swear lord kildare

now fitzwilliam, have a care
fallen is your star, low
up with halbert out with sword

see all the children of the gael, beneath o'byrne's banners
rooster of the fighting stock, would you let a saxon cock
crow out upon an irish rock, fly up and teach him manners.
from tassagart to clonmore, there flows a stream of saxon gore
och, great is rory oge o'more, sending the loons to hades.

Forty Shades of Green,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=121,"i close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea
from the fishin boats at dingle to the shores at donaghdee

the moorlands and meadows and their forty shades of green
but most of all i miss a girl in tipperary town
and most of all i miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
again i want to see and do the things we've done and seen
where the breeze is sweet as shalimar and there's forty shades of green
i wish i could spend an hour at dublin's churning surf

i have fine strong sons, who fought to save my jewels
they fought and they died, and that was my grief said she
long time ago, said the fine old woman
long time ago, this proud old woman did say
there was war and death, plundering and pillage
my children starved, by mountain, valley and sea
and their wailing cries, they shook the very heavens
my four green fields ran red with their blood, said she
what have i now, said the fine old woman
what have i now, this proud old woman did say
i have four green fields, one of them's in bondage
in stranger's hands, that tried to take it from me

Frank and Beans,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=480,"this is my answer to bob &amp; tom's camel toe song.
too many women protested after hearing camel toe and wanted to know where the song was for men wearing tight pants.

you're one helluva guy
and your pants are on so tight i
t's very clear to see if you're hanging left or right
your boys will never be free
with that pant leg lemon squeeze
self induced vasoctomies
makes it hard for you to breathe
we see your frank and beans
your sausage your pecker
it's a single decker
your penis your weenis
you must be a genius
your wizzer your wanker
no doubt a solo spanker
your frank and beans
it's got no room it must be turning green
protruding from your jeans
we see your frank and beans
oui, oui messeur, it's knocking at the door
in a case of your own
with your twix and raisinettes
the girls are taking bets
that it's not a toblerone
the pressure down below
makes your voice a soprano
wet stains from your bathroom trip
...or is it just chapstck
we see your frank and beans
your helmet is german
now we see you squirmin'
you're a grape smuggler in the land down under
we see that you're natural you're not a hebrew national

going too fast down the lane
he's a law man
his name is nelson tift
when you leave the inn at long trail
remember to down shift
it started back in grade school
a hard nosed crossing guard
he ticketed his classmates
for riding trikes too hard
he fined them their lunch money
and keep them after school
he's been tracking you since grade school
a life time constable  
he's hiding in the bushes
he's hiding in the trees
writing speeding tickets
just might be his disease
from wallingford to mendon
his radar gun he brings
writing tickets from mount holly
to middletown springs  
he ran for public office
on the principles of tift
for folks in rutland county
it might have been a gift
he should have been campaigning
instead he swung and whiffed
in culinary terms
old nelson was french dipped  
he's back in his camaro
filled with bitterness and hate
even though he's off tonight
don't drive fast when it's late
he'll read that radar signal
like and idiot savant
and you'll get a no holds barred

Galway Bay,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=123,"if you ever go across the sea to ireland

just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
the women in the meadow makin' hay
or to sit beside a turf fire in a cabin
and watch the barefoot gossoms as they play
oh the breezed blowing o're the sea from ireland
are perfumed by the heather as they blow
and the women in the uplands diggin' praties
speak a language that the strangers do not know
oh the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways
they blamed us just for bein' what we are
but they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
or light a penny candle from a star
and if there's going to be a life hereafter
and something tells me sure there's going to be

and then she can walk home without a sway;
if the sea was beer instead of salty water

well, she doesn't try to answer him in gaelic

me eyes began to dazzle and i'm goin' to see the races.
for me whack for me dew for me dithery iddle day.
there were passengers from limerick and more from tipperary
the boys from connemara and the clare unmarried ladies
people from cork city who were loyal true and faithful
broght home the fenian prisoners from dyin' in foreign nations

boys from connemara and the claire unmarried maidens

who brought home the fenian prisoners from diverse foreign nations.

the nimble footed dancers a-tripping over the daisies
there were others crying cigars and lights and bills for all the races
with the colors of the jockeys and the prize and horses' ages. 
it's there you'll see the jockeys and they're mounted out so stately
the pink, the blue, the orange, and green, the emblem of our nation
when the bell was rung for starting, all the horses seemed impatient
i thought they never stood on ground their speed was so amazing. 
there was half a million people there from all denominations
the catholic, the protestant, the jew, and presbyterian
there was yet no animosity, no matter what persuasion
but sportsman's hospitality inducin' fresh acquaintance   
it's there you'll see confectioners with sugarsticks and dainties
the lozenges and oranges, the lemonade and raisins!
the gingerbread and spices to accomodate the ladies
and a big crubeen for thruppence to be pickin' while you're able. 
it's there you'll see the gamblers, the thimbles and the garters
and the spotting wheel of fortune with the four and twenty quarters
there was others without scruple pelting wattles at poor maggy
and her father well-contented and he lookin' at his daughter. "
Galway Shawl,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=127,"in oranmore in the county galway,

i spied a damsel, she was young and handsome
her beauty fairly took my breath away.    
she wore no jewels, nor costly diamonds,
no paint or powder, no, none at all.
but she wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it
and round her shoulder was a galway shawl.
we kept on walking, she kept on talking,
'till her father's cottage came into view.
says she: 'come in, sir, and meet my father,
and play to please him "" the foggy dew."" 
she sat me down beside the fire
i could see her father, he was six feet tall.
and soon her mother had the kettle singing
all i could think of was the galway shawl.   
i played ""the blackbird"" and ""the stack of barley"",
"" rodney's glory"" and ""the foggy dew"",
she sang each note like an irish linnet.
while the tears flowedfrom her eyes so blue. 
'twas early, early, all in the morning,
when i hit the road for old donegal.
she said 'goodby, sir,'she cried
and my heart remaines with the galway shawl. "

pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones,
feel the need to grow my own, for the time is close at hand.
grain for grain, sun and rain, we are part of nature's chain,
tune my body and my brain to the music from the land.  
plant your rows straight and long, temper them with prayer and song,

and if you've no objections
i will make you my sweet wife.

and we're blessed with children three

the way they ought to go

where the praties grow."

for he always finds a corkscrew far more handy than a sword.
he's good old general guinness, he's a soldier strong and stout.
he's found on every bottlefront, and he can't be done without!
his noble name has world-wide fame, deserves three hearty cheers,
hurrah for general guinness of the dublin booziliers!
this hale and hearty warrior is worshipped in the ranks,
for he does his task inside the cask, as well as in the tanks.
and he bears the brunt on every front, north, south, east, and west,
and he's worth about ten million countin' medals on his chest.
he's good old general guinness, he has won the world's applause.
'twas him who kept our spirits up in the midst of all our wars.
who was the first to flirt with mademoiselle from armentieres?
why good old general guinness of the dublin booziliers.
all over bonny scotland too, the general is seen.
they've given him the freedom of the ""toon"" of aberdeen.
from inverness to galashiels, he keeps them warm and bright,
and they love to gather 'round him, och, on every moonlit night.
he's good old general guinness, he's as good as scottish broth,
'twas him who turned the firth of forth into the firth of froth.
all scotsman yell and dance the highland fling when he appears,
hurrah for general guinness of the dublin booziliers"
Gentle Annie,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=548,"fair and lovely annie
your gentle ways have won me
you bring peace and joy and laughter everywhere
where you go the sunshine follows
you're a breath of spring in winter
and my heart and soul are always in your care
gentle annie, gentle annie
and my heart and soul are always in your care
when you touch me with your fingers
my cares and worries vanish
like the morning dew before the rising sun
when your eyes tell me you love me
then my soul is filled with wonder
and my love for you will live when life is done
gentle annie, gentle annie
and my love for you will live when life is done
you're a flower among the flowers
a bird song in the morning
you're the laughter of the children at their play
you're my hope, my joy, my wisdom
you're my reason just for living
you're my treasure
you're my very night and day
gentle annie, gentle annie
you're my very night and day
when the mountains all have tumbled
when the earth has stopped it's turning
when the winds don't blow and stars refuse to shine
when the moon has left the heavens
when the seven seas are empty
i will still have gentle annie on my mind
gentle annie, gentle annie
i will still have gentle annie on my mind"
German Clockwinder (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=131,"a german clockwinder to dublin once came
benjamin fookes was the old german's name
and as he winded he way up the strand
he played on his flute and the music was grand
singin' too ra lumma too ra loor a lumma too ra lum lie
singin' too ra lumma too ra loor a lumma too ra lum lie
there once was a lady from grovesner's square
she said that her clock was in need of repair
in walked the bold german and to her delight
in five minutes flat he make her clock right  
now as they lie there down on the floor
there came a very big knock at the door
in came her husband
and great was his shock
for to see that the german had wound his wife's clock  
the husband said, ""now you look here mary anne""
""i don't want that bold german in here again""
""he wound up your clock you left mine on the shelf""
""if your old clock needs windin' sure i'll wind it myself!""  "
Gift (the) O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=132,"do you believe that you could love
a man you've never met
a person who lived oh so long ago
sure there are figures throughout history
we're sure we won't forget
and greater ones are sure to come and go
but this man was my grandpa
and alothough we've never met
he's guaranteed be with me all the day
for the fiddle he once played
has passed to me without regret
to me who sees his vision when i play
and when i hold you fiddle close
it's like i hold you in my arms
to thank you for the gift
you've given me
now i wonder since you left
before the day that i was born
you asked god to pass your talent
on to me
each year the fiddle seasons
and it mellow so with age
and i realize i'm a victim too of time
but your music is so rich and sweet
as i turn another page
i leave the troubles of this world behind
i open that old fiddle case
for a momory of a man
and know the music flows between the lines
an the time is growing closer
when i shake his giving hand
to thank him for the joy
he's help me find
and although you are in heaven
i know you help the angels sing
for your music is a gift
that god enjoys
so until we ever meet
i'll keep on playing here on earth
ever knowing it's our gift
that brings life joy"
Girl I Left Behind Me,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=133,"the dames of france are fond and free
and flemish lips are willing
and soft the maids of italy
and spanish eyes are thrilling
still though i bask beneath their smile
their charms fair to bind me
and my heart fall back to erin's isle
to the girl i left behind me
she's as fair as shannon's side
and purer than it's water
but she refused to bemy bride
thought many a year i sought her
yet since to france i sailed away
her letters oft remind me
that i promised never to gain say
the girl i left behind me
she says, ""my own dear love come home
my friends are rich and many
or else abroad with you i'll roam
a soldier stout as any
if you'll not come not let me go
i'll think you have resigned me""
my heart near broke when i answered,""no""
to the girl i left behind me
for never shall me true love brave
a life of was and toiling
and never as a skulking slave
i'll tread my native soil on
but were it free or to be freed
the battle close would find me
to ireland bound nor message need
from the girl i left behind me"

english translation:
farewell to the noble mountains of donegal
and twice farewell to tall erigal,
arching over rowen and ash tree
when i passed by dunlewey lake,
lying quietly in the glen
behind me were the green glens of gweedore,
it nearly broke my heart
travelling through glendowan's hills,
and muckish behind me i don't mind saying
with sorrow and grief, that tears fell from my eyes
westward to america was my journey,
far across the wide sea
i said farewell for a while to donegal,
and the green glens of gweedore
i never wanted to leave my own beloved land
but the foreigner's heavy handed deceipt
and treachery drove me away
it would be my heart's desire to return again,
when i should get a little money
to spend the end of my life with my family,
'round the green glens of gweedore
yet farewell, farewell to donegal county fine and fair
and to your brave men who in time of need,
did not ever cower before the foreigner
there's a place in my heart for each man and woman,
each child big and small
who live in peace, without sorrow or grief,
in the green glens of gweedore

Glencoe,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=502,"oh cruel is the snow that sweeps glencoe
and covers the grave o' donald
and cruel was the foe that raped glencoe
and murdered the house o' macdonald
they came through the blizzard,
we offered them heat
a roof ower their heads,
dry shoes for their feet
we wined them and dined them,
they ate o' our meat
and slept in the house o' macdonald
they came from fort william
with murder mind
the campbell had orders,
king william had signed
pit all tae the sword,
these words underlined
and leave none alive called macdonald
they came in the night when the men were asleep t
hat band of argyles, through snow soft and deep.
like murdering foxes, among helpless sheep
they slaughtered the house o' macdonald
some died in their beds at the hands of the foe
some fled in the night, were lost in the snow.
some lived to accuse him,
what struck the first blow
but gone was the house of macdonald"
Glenveagh,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=575,"in the donegal mountains
there's a park called glenveagh
where people can watch the red deer at their play
the park was the gift of a yank millionaire
who got his revenge on lord john george adare
now adare was a landlord who should have shown penance
for the want and eviction of all of his tenants
but ""to hell with ye irish!"" he loudly did jeer
instead of ye peasants i'd rather have deer
too ra loo to ra leer
instead of ye peasants i'd rather have deer
now among the evicted were the bold mcilhenny
a proud rugged family whose triumphs were many
in the land of the cajun they made good their loss
by inventing tobasco that fire red sauce
now with all of the loot they had got from this spice
they paid adare back for his criminal vice
for a grandson named henry acquired the estate
and the soul of adare was condemned to its fate
too ra loo, too ra late
and the soul of adare was condemned to its fate
in the dungeons of hell is a bubbling pit
where lord adare twitches a writhes in a fit
he wishes he never had thought to foreclose
'cause he's bathed in tobasco right up to his nose
and if at glenveagh you should hear the wind sigh
you'll know lord adare's gotten sauce in the eye
and a red antlered deamon will mock every moan
saying, ""you never showed mercy so pogue ma thoin""
too ra loo, too ra loan
saying, ""you never showed mercy so pogue ma thoin"""
Glorious Green,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=421,"no fashion designer in eden
were found though adam and eve
took a good look around said eve, '
my predicament mustn't be seen.'
the first dress she wore was a nice leafy green
: it was green green glorious green
the loveliest color that you've ever seen
when the earth was young it was nice and serene
covered all over with glorious green
though red and white roses in england
still grow they once thought each other,
but how they'ed show there are thistles in scotland
and leeks around wales in ireland
the green of the shamrock prevails
now william of orange beat james at the boyne
said he,'though he won it's only annoyin''
said the general ginkle, 'i know what you mean.
it was easy to beat james
but hard 'twas to beat green.'
now history left ireland a colorful scene
one part is orange the other is green
the north and the south they should
both look ahaed to make sure the
old country stays out of the red"

God Save Ireland,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=135,"tune:tramp, tramp, tramp the boys are marching
high upon the gallows tree swung the noble-hearted three.
by the vengeful tyrant stricken in their bloom;
but they met him face to face, with the courage of their race,
and they went with souls undaunted to their doom.
""god save ireland ! "" said the heroes;
""god save ireland"" said they all.
whether on the scaffold high
or the battlefield we die,
0, what matter when for erin dear we fall ! ""
girt around with cruel foes, still their courage proudly rose,
for they thought of hearts that loved them for and near;
of the millions true and brave o'er the ocean's swelling wave,
and the friends in holy ireland ever dear. 
climbed they up the rugged stair, rang their voices out in prayer,
then with england's fatal cord around them cast,
close beside the gallows tree kissed like brothers lovingly,
true to home and faith and freedom to the last. 
never till the latest day shall the memory pass away,
of the gallant lives thus given for our land;
but on the cause must go, amidst joy and weal and woe,
till we make our isle a nation free and grand.

put on your old caibin

and i'll have you all to know

fifty years ago.

how we danced on the village green

and called me your cailin
your hair was like a raven's wing
but now it's turning grey
come over here ould sweetheart dear,
and hear's what i've to say.
and well do i remember, when first i was you bride
in the little chapel on the hill,
where we stood side be side
of good friends we've had many,
of troubles we've had few

and here's what you must do. "

had set old ireland free
and how excited i became
when i heard the cannons roar

old ireland free once more.
it`s true we`ve had brave irishmen
as everyone must know
o`neil, o`donnell, sarsfield too
lord edward and wolfe tone
also robert emmett
who till death did not give
o`er gra mo chree, i long to see
old ireland free once more.
now we can't forget the former years
they're kept in memory still
of the wexford men of '98
who fought on vinegar hill
with father murphy at their side
and the green flag waving o'er
oh gra mo chree, i long to see
old ireland free once more.

their country to set free
someday soon brave irish men
will make the english flee
by day and night they`ll always fight

oh grace just hold me in your arms ad let this moment linger
they'll take me out at dawn and i will die
with all my love i place this wedding ring upon your finger
there won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye.
now i know it's hard for you my love to ever understand
the love i bear for these brave men, my love for this dear land
but when the padhraic called me to his side down in the gpo
i had to leave my own sick bed, to him i had to go  
now as dawn is breaking, my heart is breaking too,
on this may morn as i walk out my thoughts well be of you

Grandfather's Immigrant Eyes,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=556,"old ellis island was swarming
like a scene from a costume ball
decked out in the colors in europe
and on fire with the hope of it all
there stood my father's own father stood huddled
with the tired and hungry and scared
turn of the century pilgrims
bound by the dream that they shared
they were standing in lines just like cattle
poked and prodded and shoved
some were one desk away from sweet freedom
some were torn from someone they loved
through this sprawling tower of babel
came a young man confused and alone
determined and bound for america
carrying everything that he owned
sometimes when i look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
i see that day reflected and i can't hold my feelings inside
i see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life
so don't take it for granted say grandfather's immigrant eyes
now he rocks and stares out the window
but his eyes are still just as clear
as the day when he sailed 'cross the harbor
to come ashore on the island of tears
now my grandfather's days they are numbered
but i won' t let his memory die
for he gave me the gift of this country
and the look in his emigrant eyes"

where the ocean kisses ireland
and the waves carress it's shore
oh the feeling it came over me
to stay forever more
forever more
from it's rolling coastal waters
i can see croagh patrick's peak
where one sunday every summer
the pilgrims climb the reek
where saint patrick in his solitude
looked down across clew bay
and with a ringing of his bell
called the faithful there to pray
there to pray
oh take me to clare island
the home of granuaile
it's waters harbour fishes
from the herring to the whale
and now i must depart it
and reality is plain
may the time not pass so slowly
before i set sail again
set sail again
the green and red of mayo

it's tall majestic hills
where the ocean kisses ireland
and the waves carress it's shore

Green Fields of France a.k.a. Willie McBride,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=137,"did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly,
did they sound the death march as they lowered you down
did the band play the last post and ,
did the pipes play the ""flowers of the forest""
well how do you do young willie mcbride?
do you mind if i sit down here by your graveside
and rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun
i've been walkin' all day and i'm nearly done
i see by your gravestone you were only nineteen
when you joined the great fallen of 1916
well i hope you died quick and i hope you died clean
willie mcbride was it slow and obscene   
and the beautiful wife or the sweetheart for life
in some faithful heart are you forever enshrined
and although you died back in 1916
in that faithful heart are you forever nineteen?
or are you a stranger without even a name
enshrined forever behind a glass pane
in an ould photograph torn tattered and stained,
fading to yellow in a brown leather frame?   
now the sun shines down on the green fields of france
a warm summer wind makes the red poppys dance
the trences have vanished under the plows,
there's no gas no barbed wire, there's no guns firing now
but here in this graveyard it's still no man's land,
the countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
for man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
to a whole generation that was butchered and damned   
now willie mcbride i can't help wonder why
do those who lie here do they know why they died
did they really beleive when they answered the call
did they really believe that this war would end wars
forever this song of suffereing and shame
the killing the dying was all done in vain
for young willie mcbride it's all happened again,
and again, and again, and again and again"

at four grey walls that surround me
and i realize that i was only dreaming.
for there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,
arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak.
again i'll touch
the green, green grass of home.
yes, they'll all come to see me
in the shade of that old oak tree
as they lay me
'neath the green, green grass of home."

my waistline is growing i'm as round as i've been

there's only one problem...i can't find my keys

rose in the morning ...and rose all the night
but now mother nature how she's grabbing me
i'm a victim of time and of earth's gravity
i recall my gyrations and my joints start to creak
my spirit is willing but my flesh is too weak
i heard in my youth, 'this is life. drink it up!'
in hindsight it seems as though i drank too much
for the years crept upon me and now it's official
more of my parts are replaced artificial
i've got glasses and pins and aids for my hearing
a new plastic hip and support hose i'm wearing
i've got magnets and wraps 'cause i'm moving so slow
my big date of the month is with my hmo
i could do any job building railroads and trestles
constructing the highways and overseas vessels
but my only tools now are the mortar and pestle
i'm thrilled when i'm first at the early bird special
i can see what's ahead, what lies down the pike
pretty soon i won't be doing my driving at night
so i'll hike up my pants as i prepare for the last
place my hat on a shelf and my teeth in a glass"

so sleeps the pride of former days so glory's thrill is over
and hearts that once beathigh for praise
now feels that pulse no more
no more to chiefs and ladies bright
the harp of tara' swells
the chord alone that breaks at night
its tale of ruin tells
thus freedon now so seldom wakes
the only throb she gives
is when some heart indignant breaks
to show that still she lives"

He Was Superman,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=577,"this is a short song written for lenny burke whom i met at the inn at long trail. he was a tremendous athlete who was on the fast track to division 1 basketball. he also shot par golf the first time he was on a course.
in his senior year he was undercut under the basket and suffered a traumatic brain injury. it was then his path changed to effect the lives of hundreds of others.
his courageous mother emmy did research on her own to attempt to assist in lenny's recovery from his 46 day coma. the results were so remarkable they formed lenny burke's farm in vermont and have since helped people with tbi from around the world.
his outlook was always positive, his humor was quick and he understood completely the change in life's path.
a book was written about his life, a bend in the road and at a book signing he quipped, ""i wish my name was al.""
lenny passed june 22nd at age 56 after nearly 40 year's with a tbi.
he was superman
and the buildings he would bound
he could clear without a sound
he touched the sky
he was superman
and the strength that was renowned
wasn't measured by the pound
it was in his eyes
and i hope you think it's right
that the purpose of each life
is to reach as many people as you can
count those people on one hand
for an ordinary man
but it's countless lives when
you are a superman
he was superman
and the powers he was given
and the life that he was living
would change and he embraced it to the end
he mom was lois lane, no ordinary dame
and his jimmy was no ordinary friend
and if you ever met him
you'd surely not forget him
he was superman"

Heroes Among Us  O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=145,"when you feel that you're alone
nowhere to turn
when the world had turned it's
back on you
and all you have is prayer
there is always someone close to you
who will gladly lend a hand
a soldier from the heavens
to help you make your stand
there are angels
here with me and you
never thinking twice
when there are good things to do
when a child cries
you can see it in their eyes
they're longing for a hero,
a hero by their side
when the pages of our history are read
when we recall our darkest days
when the brave were laid to rest
when our character and innocence
were both put to the test
we would rise
and then show all the world
our way of life is best
there are children
who never did know bad
they would never know
the families they once had
still we hope and pray
there will come a day
when sacrafices made
will make our world
a better safer place
bridge:
we must not forget
when this world forever changed
those who gave their lives
were the bravest of the brave
they left behind all those
who live to carry on
the day when all the heroes
left their homes...left their homes
there are angels,
and here they can be found
giving love and comfort
at the first distressful sound
they seem far away
but we're never far apart
they're guiding those they love
for now the hero's living
in our hearts
i wrote this with many people in mind. of course all the innocent people who lost their lives on september 11th. i can't help but think when i hear someone say ""is your life back to normal?"" that there are multiple numbers of people whose lives will never be normal again.
i think we all acted like heroes as a nation when we responded with blood and money for people we didn't even know. just because they were fellow american's and human beings. that's what we're all about. the will of those who lost their lives is being carried out by those of us who are able to help in this world."

Hoarders,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=584,"you feel your lifes in danger
and now you need to hoard
you watch the cable news
to get the latest word
you must protect your family
so you become insane
throw logic out the window
while you use your lizard brain
you think about the hardships of the past
and wonder just how long your
supplies will last
but be rest assured , since youre skillful at the hoard
that youll leave this world with the cleanest ass.
what makes you think that you can just relax
while youre stocking up with those family packs
im wondering if covid is your greatest fear
or youre planning that youll die from diarrhea
there are others who are not the hoarding sort
who fear 14 days with the hershey squirts
its not paper that they save
but a sparking butt they crave
while installing porcelain bidets
its your fellow man youre harming
while you stockpile all the charmin
your priorities are slightly out of whack
youre not showing too much class
hoarding hospital masks
and preoccupied with cleaning out your crack."
Holy Ground (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=147,"fare thee well, my lovely dinah, a thousand times adieu.
we are bound away from the holy ground and the girls we love so true.

you're the girl that i adore,
and still i live in hope to see the holy ground once more.

fine letters will i write to you with the secrets of my mind,

oh now the storm is raging and we are far from shore;
the poor old ship she's sinking fast and the riggings they are tore.
the night is dark and dreary, we can scarcely see the moon,
but still i live in hope to see the holy ground once more.
it's now the storm is over and we are safe on shore
we'll drink a toast to the holy ground and the girls that we adore.
we'll drink strong ale and porter and we'll make the taproom roar,
and when our money is all spent we'll go to sea once more."

Honeymoon For Two O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=149,"we began this honeymoon,
wrote the music and the tune
then the words came with our vows
as the years allowed
as the years continued on
you put the music in our song
add a measure of your time
the candlelight and wine
on this honeymoon for two
words can not express the way i feel for you
if this feeling must be love
it's the only time ""i love you's"" not enough
there's still a spark when you come home
your beauty still lights up a room
you turn the embers to a flame
make sunshine out of rain
we play life's game draw our cards
life with me's been pretty hard
still the years keep marching by
and you're still by my side    
bridge
that sparkle in your eye
makes my heart begin to fly
you fill me up, this love i can't deny
through the years as we grow old
we hope the story we have told
will guide our children through their lives
and keep their fires bright
still one day this life will close
there's no wilting of our rose
for we've built a legacy
for all eternity      "

how are things in glocca morra?
is that little brook still leaping there?
does it still run down to donny cove?
through killybegs, kilkerry and kildare?
how are things in glocca mora?
is that willow tree still weeping there?
does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
come smilin' by and does she walk away,
sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
so i ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
and each lass that comes a-sighin"" too ra lay

Humors of Whiskey (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=151,"let your quacks and newspapers be cutting their capers
about curing the vapors the scratch and the gout
with their medical potions, their serums and their lotions
upholding their notions, they're mighty put out.
who can tell the true physic to all that's pathetic
and pitch to the divil, cramp, colic and spleen
you'll know it i think if you take a big drink
with your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen
so stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
oh what botheration, no dose in the nation
can give consolation like poteen me boys.
no liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic
or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom
as the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers
ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume
and this liquid so rare if you willingly share
to be taking your hair when it's frizzled and dead
oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit
so strong it will shake all the hairs from your head
then stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
oh since its perfection, no doctor's direction
can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys
while a child in me cradle, me nurse with her ladle
was filling my mouth with a notion of pap
when a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle
i stumbled and capered clean out of her lap
on the floor i lay crawlin' and screaming and bawling
'til me mother and father were called to the fore
all sobbing and sighing they feared i was dying
but soon found i only was crying for more.
so stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
oh lord how they'd chuckle if babes in their truckle
they only could suckle on poteen me boys
through my youthful aggression, through times of depression
my childhood's impression still clung to my mind
and at school or at college the basis of knowledge
i never could gulp 'til with whiskey combined
and as older i'm growing times ever bestowin'
on erin's potation, a flavor so fine
and how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar
itself is the only true liquid divine
so stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
oh lord, 'tis the right thing for courting and fighting
there's nowt so exciting as poteen me boys.
come guess me this riddle, what beats pipes and fiddle
what's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
what best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
what's sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
what'll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,
the elixir of life and philospher's stone
and what helped mr. brunnell to build the thames tunnel
wasn't it poteen from ould inisowen
so stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
oh lord, it's no wonder, if lightning and thunder
weren't made from the plunder of poteen me boys.
you maidens pathetic, with lovers athletic
for liquid cosmetic, you can't beat the drop
with a glow to your cheek, it will make your heart leap
it'll quiet a stallion or cure an old cob
at the mouth you would drool, be reduced to a fool
you'd kick up your heels and you'd peel to the buff
then 'tis he'd be pathetic while you'd be athletic
if only you'd take a few drops of the stuff
so stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
for there's nothing like whiskey to make maidens frisky
it soon separates all the men from the boys."
Humours of Donnybrook Fair,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=470,"to donnybrook steer all you sons of parnassus
poor painters, poor poets, poor newsmen and knaves
to see what the fun is that all fun surpasses
the sorrows and sadness of green erin's slaves
oh donnybrook jewel!
full of mirth is your quiver
where all flock from dublin to gape and to stare
at two elegant bridges without e'er a river
so success to the humours of donnybrook fair
oh you lads that are witty, from famed dublin city
and you that in pastime take any delight
to donnybrook fly, for the time's drawing nigh
when fat pigs are hunted and lean cobblers fight
when maidens so swift run for a new shift
men muffled in sacks, for a shirt they race there
there jockeys well booted and horses sure-footed
all keep up the humours of donnybrook fair
the mason does come with his line and his plumb
the sawyer and carpenter, brothers in chips
there are carvers and guilders and all sorts of builders
with soldiers from barracks and sailors from ships
there confectioners, cooks and the printers of books
there stampers of linen and weavers repair
there widows and maids and all sorts of trades
go join in the humours of donnybrook fair
there tinkers and nailers and beggars and tailors
and singers of ballads and girls of the sieve
with barrack street rangers, the known ones and strangers
and many that no one can tell how they live
there horsemen and walkers and likewise fruit-hawkers
and swindlers the devil himself that would dare
with pipers and fiddlers and dandlers and diddlers
all met in the humours of donnybrook fair
'tis there are dogs dancing and wild beasts a-prancing
with neat bits of painting, red, yellow and gold
toss players and scramblers and showmen and gamblers
pick-pockets in plenty, the young and the old
there are brewers and bakers and jolly shoemakers
with butchers and porters and men that cut hair
there are montebanks grinning, while others are sinning
to keep up the humours of donnybrook fair
brisk lads and young lassies can fill up their glasses
with whiskey and send a full bumper around
jig it off in a tent till their money's all spent
and spin like a top till they rest on the ground
oh donnybrook capers to sweet cat-gut scrapers
they bother the vapours and drive away care
and what is more glorious, there's naught more uproarious
hurrah for the humours of donnybrook fair"
I Had A Hat When I Came In,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=416,"casey wore his brand new hat to murphy's wake last night
someone stole his hat and, bo, it started up a fight
casey smashed the furniture the radio as well
he nearly woke the corpse up as he began to yell
i had a hat when i came in i hung it on the rack
and i'll have a hat when i go out or i'll break somebody's back
i'm a peaceful loving man i am, and i don't want to shout,
but i had a hat when i came in, and i'll have a hat when i go out!
casey kept on fighting sure they couldn't keep him quiet
someone phoned up for the cops to come and stop the riot
two cops then rushed into the room, but casey laid them out
as he threw them through the window, they both heard casey shout
casey kept on fighting until one eyed paddy flynn
socked him on the whiskers with a great big rolling pin
he knocked poor casey senseless, it was an awful clout
as he lay there unconscious casey kept on shouting out i had a hat.."

thy loving heart will cease to yearn
where laughs the little silver stream
beside your mother's humble cot
and brightest rays of sunshine gleam
to where your grief will be forgot

I'll Tell Me Ma,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=153,"i'll tell me ma when i come home
the boys won't leave the girls alone
they pull me hair and stole my comb
well that's alright till i come home
she is handsome she is pretty
she's the belle of belfast city
she's a courtin' one two three (3 claps)
please won't you tell me who is she
albert mooney says he loves her
all the boys are fightin' for her
knock at the door and ring at the bell
tell me oh you true love ""are you well""
out she comes as white as snow
rings on her fingers bells on her toes
old johnny murray say's she'll die
if she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye 
let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high
the snow come tumblin' from the sky
she's as fine as apple pie
she'll get own own love by and by
when she gets a lad of her own
she won't tell her mom when she comes home
let them all come as you will
it's albert mooney she loves still  "
I'm Drinking Vodka for Jesus,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=486,"i wrote this song for a guy (john) in cleveland who proudly told me that he gave up beer for lent. he was holding a pint glass of what looked like ice water. when i asked him what he drinking he proudly announced, 'vodka!' so i wrote a song called 'i'm drinking vodka for jesus' here's the lyrics for a chuckle (i hope). don't be afraid, i'm already excommunicated.
i'm drinking vodka for jesus intro:
lent it is a solemn time for prayer and sacrifice
to give up something that you love or maybe its a vice
maybe you can do a deed in service to the lord
and hope like all good catholics you wont perish by the sword
thats why () im drinkin vodka for jesus
for jesus, the son of god the christ
im drinkin vodka for jesus and that is my lenten sacrifice
ill avoid whats from the tap to keep the devil off my back
ill testify there is no power higher
when i chose a different flavor it was for my lord and savior
to shun guinness and instead pour stolichnaya 
your first miracle divine was turning water into wine
in every earthen jar or glass and bottle
but im turning beer into vodka 'cause i could never top ya'!
im doing what i can as a mere mortal 
when god hears what ive done to revere the holy one
to achieve a spiritual high with vodka seven
the pearly gates will swing and saint pete will say, straight in! while the angels raise a toast to me in heaven 
ive heard hells a place that stinks so im stickin with well drinks
for 40 days my plan ill not refute
but st. patricks on a monday and to ensure it is a fun day
ill use my sunday lenten substitute 
if its chocolate you deny or any cake or pie
or any fine dessert thats on the list
my reward will be supurb cause i kicked beer to the curb
while im sufferin' with grey goose and a twist "

her petticoat needs a border,

jim o'shea was cast away
upon an indian isle

they liked his irish smile
they named him chief pan jan drum
nabob of them all
they call'd him ji-ji-boo jhai
and they rigg'd him out so gay
so he wrote to dublin bay
to his sweetheart just to say
sure i've got rings on my fingers
bells on my toes
elephants to ride upon
my little irish rose
so come to your nabob
and next st. patrick's day be

to see her nabob grand
he sat within his palanquin
and when she kissed his hand
he led her to his harem

she started shedding a tear

i'm keeping these wives here
just for ornament my dear.""

to share with him his throne

with smiles her face will shine

If You're Irish Come Into the Parlour,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=157,"if you're irish come into the parlor,
there's a welcome there for you;
if your name is timothy or pat,
so long as you come from ireland,
there's a welcome on the mat,
if you come from the mountains of mourne,
or killarney's lakes so blue,
we'll sing you a song and we'll make a fuss,
whoever you are you are one of us,
if you're irish, this is the place for you!
in sweet lim'rick town, they say,
lived a chap named patrick john molloy.
once he sailed to u.s.a.
his luck in foreign parts he thought he'd try.
now he's made his name, and is a wealthy man,
he put a bit away for a rainy day;
so if you gaze upon
the house of patrick john,
you'll find a notice that goes on to say:
patrick loved the girl he wed,
but he could not stand his ma-in-law,
once with joy he turned quite red,
when she got into trouble thro' her jaw.
six police they had to take her to the court,
she was informed a month she would have to do,
so patrick quickly wrote
up to the judge a note
explaining, ""sir, i'm much obliged to you!"""
Immigrant Eyes,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=459,"old ellis island was swarming,
like a scene from a costume ball,
decked out in the colors of europe,
on fire with the hope of it all,
they were standing in line just like cattle,
they were pushed and sorted and shoved;
some were one desk away from sweet freedom;
some were torn from someone they loved.
to this sprawling tower of babel
came a young man confused and alone;
determined and bound for america;
carrying everything that he owned;
my father's own father stood huddled
with the tired and the hungry and scared,
a turn of the century pilgrim,
in love with the dream that they shared.
sometimes when i look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes,
i see that day reflected, i can't hold my feelings inside.
i see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life,
'so don't take it for granted' say grandfather's immigrant eyes.
now he rocks and he stares out the window,
but his eyes are still just as clear
as the day he sailed into the harbor,
to land on the island of tears.
my grandfather's days are numbered,
but i won't let his memory die,
for he gave me the gift of this country,
and the look in his emigrant eyes.
sometimes when i look in my grandfather's emigrant eyes,
i see that day reflected, i can't hold my feelings inside.
i see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life,
'so don't take it for granted' say grandfather's emigrant eyes.
how i gaze with pride at my children,
and i marvel how quickly they've grown,
born and raised in america,
it's the only home they've ever known.
they never knew their great-granddad,
or that he was determined and wide,
but i hope that i've passed on his spirit;
and the look in his emigrant eyes.
sometimes when i look in my grandfather's emigrant eyes,
i see that day reflected, i can't hold my feelings inside.
i see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life,
'so don't take it for granted' say grandfather's emigrant eyes."
In My Liverpool Home,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=159,"in my liverpool home, in my liverpool home
we speak with an accent exceedingly rare,
meet under a statue exceedingly bare,
and if you want a cathedral, we've got one to spare
in my liverpool home
i was born in liverpool, down by the docks
me religion was catholic, occupation hard knocks
at stealing from lorries i was adept,
and under an overcoat each night we slept
way back in the forties the world had gone mad
mister hitler threw at us everything that he had
when the smoke and dust had all cleared from the air
""thank god"" said me da that the pier head's still there!
when i grew up i met bridget mcgann
she said ""your not much but i'm needin' a man""
""for i want sixteen kids and a house out in speke""
well the spirit was willing but the flesh it was weak
there's a place in dis city were the nits de wear clogs
they've six millon kids and ten million dogs
de play tick with hatchets and i'll tell you no lie
a man's a coward if he has more than one eye.
the green and the orange have battled for years
they've given us some laughs and they've given us some tears
but scousers don't want a heavenly reward
they just want the green card to get into fords
the dockers umbrella has bitten the dust
you might buy a meccanno, no charge for the rust
scottie road is a legend now past away
but you can go down to yateses and drink all the day.
""what's your religion?' a feller once said
so i climbed in me 'wellies' and i kung fooed his head
""oy! hold on!"" he said, ""i'm not starting a nark""
""do you worship at anfield or goodison park?"""
In the Town of Ballybay,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=160,"in the town of ballybay, there was a lassie dwellin,'
i knew her very well and her story's wortha-tellin.'
her father kept a still and he was a good distiller,
but when it came to drink, sure the devil wouldn't fill her.
and she had a wooden leg that was hollow down the middle
she used to tie a string and she'd play it like a fiddle.
she'd fiddle in the hall, she'd fiddle in the alleyway,
she didn't give a ----, she had to fiddle anyway.
and she said she couldn't dance unless she had her wellies* on,
but when she had 'em on she would dance as well as anyone.
she wouldn't go to bed unless she had her shimmie on,
but when she had it on she would go as quick as anyone.
she had lovers by the score, every tom and dick and harry,
she was courted night and day, but still she wouldn't marry.
and then she fell in love with fellow with a stammer,
when he tried to run away, she hit him with a hammer.
she had children up the stairs, she had children in the byre**
and another ten or twelve sittin' rottin' by the fire.
she fed 'em on potatoes, and soup she made with nettles,
and lumps of hairy bacon that she boiled up in the kettle.
so she led a sheltered life, eating porridge and black puddin,'
she terrorized her man, until he died right sudden.
and when the husband died, she was feelin' very sorry
so she rolled him in a bag and she threw him in the quarry."
Ireland's Call,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=452,"come the day and come the hour
come the power and the glory
we have come to answer our country's call
from the four proud provinces of ireland
ireland, ireland together standing tall
shoulder to shoulder
we'll answer ireland's call
from the mighty glens of antrim
from the rugged hills of galway
from the walls of limerick and dublin bay
from the four proud provinces of ireland
hearts of steel and heads unbowing
vowing never to be broken
we will fight, until we can fight no more
from the four proud provinces of ireland
with the ireland rugby team representing both the republic and northern ireland, 'ireland's call' was scripted to help cross sectarian and national divides and adopted as the rugby anthem in 1995. however, at home matches in dublin the irish national anthem, the soldier's song, is also sung."
Irish Curse O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=161,"there was a pregnant lady
and her time was any day
she felt a tringe below the belt
and ""ooo""'s all she could say
the ultrasound revealed it was a boy who's coming out
she only wished a healthy lad
who was handsome strong and stout
well the babe popped out in glory
as he wriggled screamed and cried
then the beaming husband
looked to his wife with pride
they both turned to the doctor and they asked him what he thought
he counted all appendages and his face with pain was wrought
""what's wrong!"" the dad exclaimed
""does he not have all his digits?""
the doc confirmed the fingers and toes
and said it was his widgit
the doctor felt a need right then to educate the nurse
""i'm afraid that master murphy's got the classic irish curse!""
oh the irish curse effects a man
right to his very root
it's the only thing in life
that can be samll but not be cute
few things in life can be so grim
or be considered worse
than the stem upon you apple
cast with the irish curse
well the dad began to panic
he saw a future filled with fear
he suggested to the doctor
he blow in the baby's ear
the doc asked for the rationale
and looked at dad with doubt
""perhaps the increased pressure
will make that thing pop out!""
well years went by young murphy
he grew from babe to boy
but he had to wait till christmas
to find his favorite toy
he discovered he was an athelete
and played at many sports
he was swift and agile
but in a smaller size of shorts
well he grew into a man
and how he worked at all his talents
trying to upset the curse
and even up the balance
he grew adept at story telling
country pride and song
and although he grew well rounded
he never did grow long.
who through the irish curse in
master murphy's trousers
nobody spoke so they shouted all the louder
it's an irish myth that's true
i could lick the mick that threw
the irish curse in master murphy's trousers"

or on the high seas

would rather be

got nothing on me
with the wind in my hair
and the sun on the sea
when we get to the dock
there'll be a guinness in me
and all of the food is cholesterol free 
a mud slide on land
is a perilous sight
but the ones on the boat's
a culinary delight
they burned up fifteen blenders
on one fateful night
now they use the propeller
which works out just right 
mike is the captain
a man for the ages
the first mate is sylvia
who's laughter's contagious
they even serve children
don't think that's outrageous
they've served all of gerber's
flavors and stages 
the best friends you have
may only meet yearly
if you have friends like that this
it comes to you clearly
if you've a long distance friend
then toast them with me
the fine people i know
and their friendship at sea"
Irish Rover,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=164,"in the year of our lord, eighteen hundred and six
we set sail from the fair cobh of cork.
we were bound far away with a cargo of bricks
for the fine city hall of new york.
she's an elegant craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft
and oh, how the wild winds drove her.
she had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
and we called her the irish rover.
there was barney mcgee from the banks of the lee,
there was hogan from county tyrone.
there was johnny mcgurk who was scared stiff of work
and a chap from west meade called malone.
there was slugger o'toole who was drunk as a rule
and fighting bill casey from dover.
and your man mick mccann from the banks of the bann
was skipper of the irish rover.
we had one million bags of the best sligo rags,
we had two million barrels of bone
we had three million bales of old nanny goat tails
we had four million barrels packets of  stone
we had five million hogs, we had six million dogs,
and seven million barrels of porter.
we had eight million sides of old blind horses hides
in the hold of the irish rover.
we had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
and the ship lost her way in a fog.
and the whole of the crew was reduced unto two,
'twas myself and the captain's old dog.
then the ship struck a rock good lord what a shock
we nearly tumbled over,
turned nine times around, and the poor dog was drowned
i'm the last of the irish rover."

""you'll win my boy don't fear""
and with loving arms around his waist
she tied his bandolier
""goodbye god bless you mother dear
i hope your heart won't pain
but pray to god your soldier boy
you soon will see again
for when i'm out in the firing line
'twill be a source of joy
to know that you're remembering still
your irish soldier boy"".
the fighting it was over
and the flag of truce was raised
the leaders ordered the fire to cease
all ireland stood amazed
his comrades came to her cottage door
with a note from her pride and joy
with sad news in sad detail
from her irish soldier boy.

in a land beyond the sky

we'll fight and fall beneath its folds, like irish volunteers!
then raise the harp of erin, boys, the flag we all revere
we'll fight and fall beneath its folds, like irish volunteers!
when i was driven form my home by an oppressor's hand,
i cut my sticks and greased my brogues, and came o'er to this land.
i found a home an many friends, and some that i love dear;
be jabbers! i'll stick to them like bricks and an irish volunteer.
then fill your glasses up, my boys, and drink a hearty cheer,
to the land of our adoption and the irish volunteer!
then fill your glasses up, my boys, and drink a hearty cheer,
to the land of our adoption and the irish volunteer!
now when the traitors in the south commenced a warlike raid,
i quickly then laid down my hod, to the devil went my spade!
to a recruiting-office then i went, that happened to be near,
and joined the good old ""sixty-ninth,"" like and irish volunteer.
then fill the ranks and march away!--no traitors do we fear;
we'll drive them all to blazes, says the irish volunteer.
then fill the ranks and march away!--no traitors do we fear;
we'll drive them all to blazes, says the irish volunteer
when the prince of wales came over here, and made a hubbaboo,
oh, everybody turned out, you know, in gold and tinsel too;
but then the good old sixty-ninth didn't like these lords or peers
they wouldn't give a damn for kings, the irish volunteers!
we love the land of liberty, its laws we will revere,
""but the divil take nobility!"" says the irish volunteer!
we love the land of liberty, its laws we will revere,
""but the divil take nobility!"" says the irish volunteer!
now if the traitors in the south should ever cross our roads,
we'll drive them to the divil, as saint patrick did the toads;
we'll give them all short nooses that come just below the ears,
made strong and good of irish hemp by irish volunteers.
then here's to brave mcclennan whom the arny now reveres
he'll lead us on to victory, the irish volunteers.
then here's to brave mcclellan, whom the army now reveres
he'll lead us on to victory, the irish volunteers.
now fill your glasses up, my boys, a toast come drink with me,
may erin's harp and the starry flag united ever be;
may traitors quake, and rebels shake, and tremble in their fears,
when next they meet the yankee boys and irish volunteers!
god bless the name of washington! that name this land reveres;

where fleas and bedbugs and mice were a-plenty,
a three-legged stool and a table to match,
and a hole on the floor for the chickens to scratch.
go into the house with the dirt to your knees,
on the corner of the bed you see the fleas,
the fleas are as big as kernels of corn,
and this is the house where the irishman's born.
another version submitted by ruth mckeown
did you ever go into and irishmans shanty
where money was scarce and whiskey was plenty,
a three legged stool and a table to match,
and a door upon hinges without any latch."
"Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears",https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=434,"on the first day of january eighteen ninety-two
they opened ellis island and they let the people through.
and the first to cross the threshold
of the isle of hope and tears
was annie moore from ireland
who was all of fifteen years.
 isle of hope, isle of tears,
isle of freedom, isle of fears,
but it's not the isle i left behind...
that isle of hunger, isle of pain,
isle you'll never see again
but the isle of home is always on your mind.
in her little bag she carried
all her past and history
and her dreams for the future in the land of liberty.
and courage is the passport
when your old world disappears
cause there's no future in the past
when you're fifteen years.
when they closed down ellis island
in nineteen forty-three
seventeen million people had come there for sanctuary.
and in springtime when i came here
and stepped onto its piers,
i thought of how it must have been
when you're only fifteen years.

Isle of Innisfree,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=170,"these are the correct words given to me by dick farrelly's son gerard
i've met some folks who say that i'm a dreamer
and i've no doubt there's truth in what they say
but sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
when all the things he loves are far away.
and precious things are dreams onto an exile
they take him o'er the land across the sea
especially when it happens he's an exile
from that dear lovely isle of innisfree.
and when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
of this great city wondrous tho' it be
i scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
i'm once again back home in innisfree.
i wander o'er green hills thro' dreamy valleys
and find a peace no other land could know
i hear the birds make music fit for angels
and watch the rivers laughing as they flow.
and then into a humble shack i wander
my dear old home, and tenderly behold
the folks i love around the turf fire gathered
on bended knees their rosary is told.
but dreams don't last
tho' dreams are not forgotten
and soon i'm back to stern reality
but tho' they paved the footways here with gold dust
i still would choose the isle of innisfree.

it is the melody and not the words that feature in the film. "
Isn't It Grand Boys?,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=171,"1. well look at the coffin, with its golden handles

the sooner you bloody well die"
It's A Great Day for the Irish,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=439,"it's a great day for the irish,
it's a great day for the fair!
the sidewalks of new york are thick with blarney,

It's a Long Way to Tipperary,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=172,"up to mighty london came an irishman one day,
as the streets are paved with gold, sure ev'ryone was gay;
singing songs of piccadilly, strand and leicester square,
till paddy got excited, then he shouted to them there:
it's a long way to tipperary
it's a long was to go
it's a long way to tipperary
to the sweetest gal i know
farewell to piccadilly
so long leister square
it's a long way to tipperary
but my heart lies there
paddy wrote a letter to his irish molly o,
saying, ""should you not receive it,
write and let me know!
if i make mistakes in spelling, molly dear,"" said he
"" remember it's the pen that's bad,
don't lay the blame on me.""
molly wrote a neat reply to irish paddy o.
saying. ""mike mahoney wants to marry me, and so
leave the strand and piccadilly, or you'll be to blame
for love has fairly drove me silly, hoping you're the same!"""
It's Not the Reason I Left Mullingar,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=173,"i walk through the city a stranger
in a place i could never call home
and cast the sad notion before me
in search of my fortunes to roam
i weary of workin' and drinkin'
my weeks wages left in the bar
and lord it's a shame for to use a friend's name
just to beg for the price of a jar
i remember that bright april mornin' i left home to travel afar
to work till you're dead fro one room and a bed
it's not the reason i left mulingar
this london's a city of heartbreak
on friday there's friends by the score
but when the pay's finished on monday
your friend's not your friend anymore
i'm weary of workin' and drinkin'
from a shovel and pick there's no break
and when you're not workin' you're spendin'
that fortune you left home to make 
for every man here who finds fortune
and comes home to tell the tale
each morning the broadway is crowded
with the manys the thousands who failed
so young men of ireland take warnin'
in london you may never find
the gold at the end of the rainbow
you just may have left it behind  "

James Connolly,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=176,"a great crowd had gathered outside of kilmeinhem,
with their heads uncovered they knelt on the ground.
from inside that grim prison lay a brave irish soldier,
his life for his country about to lay down.
he went to his death like a true son of ireland,
the firing party he bravely did face,
then the order rang out: ""present arms, fire!""
james connolly fell into a ready-made grave.
the black flag they hoisted the cruel deed was over,
gone was the man who loved ireland so well.
there was many a sad heart in dublin that morning,
when they murdered james connolly, the irish rebel!.
god's curse on you, england, you cruel-hearted monster
your deeds they would shame all the devils in hell.
there are no flowers blooming but the shamrock is growing
on the grave of james connolly, the irish rebel!.
many years have rolled by since that irish rebellion,
when the guns of britannia they loudly did speak.
the bold i.r.a. they stood shoulder to shoulder,
and the blood from their bodies flowed down sackville street.
the four courts of dublin the english bombarded,
the spirit of freedom they tried hard to quell.
for above all the din rose the cry 'no surrender,'
'twas the voice of james connolly, the irish rebel. "

i'm a man you don't meet every day.
i have acres of land; i have men at command;
(and) i have always a shilling to spare. (and many )
now, i took out my gun, with my dog i did shoot,
all down by the river kildare (banks of the try)
i'm a piper by trade and a roving young blade
and many a tune i do play

and whatever the cost, i will pay"
Jodi's Ship,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=178,"in memory i stand on the shore each day
and watch jodi's white ship sail away
from he sheltering shores to the deep deep sea
clearing the billows and sailing away from me
out where the ocean meets the sky
out where an unknown mystery lies
i follow her course to the distant blue
there faded our jodi's ship from view
i know that your ship is out to sea
breasting the billows wild and free
there tenderly spoke an angel thought
and a nessage of peace it to me brought
tis this mortal mind in dim dismay
watch loved ones pass from our narrow bay
like ships that go sailing far away
never again to come our way
i know that your ship is out to sea
breasting the billows wild and free
there tenderly spoke an angel thought
and a nessage of peace it to me brought
you loved one is not dead for the life ship sails
for our short sight unseen still fails
and as the weeks and months go by
time will soften the sadness in your eyes
and heal the wound with a kindly touch
and we'll speak of her whom we loved so much
and when this race on earth is run
with glad hearts we'll say
""thy will be done""
i know that your ship is out to sea
breasting the billows wild and free
there tenderly spoke an angel thought
and a nessage of peace it to me brought"
Joe McDonnell,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=179,"o' my name is joe mcdonnell from belfast town i came
that city i will never see again
for in that town of belfast i spent many happy days
i love that town in oh so many ways.
for it's there i spent my childhood and found for me a wife
and set out to make for her a life.
but all my young ambitions met with bitterness and hate
i soon found myself inside a prison gate.
and so you call me a terrorist
while you look down your gun
when i think of all the deeds that you have done,
you have plundered many nations
divided many lands
you have terrorized their people
you ruled with an iron hand.
and you brought this reign of terror to my land.
though those many months internment in the and the maze
i thought about my land thoughout those days
why my country was divided
why i was now in jail
imprisoned without cause or without trial.
and although i love my country
i am not a bitter man
i have seen cruelty and injustice first hand.
then one fateful morning i shook bold freedom's hand
for right or wrong i tried to free my land.  
then one cold october's morning trapped in the lion's den
i found myself imprisoned once again
i was committed to the h blocks for fourteen years or more
on the blanket the conditions there were poor
than a hunger strike we did commence for the dignity of man
but it seems to me that no one gave us a damn
and now i am a saddened man i've watched my comrades die
but no one seemed to care or wonder why
may god shine on you bobby sands for the courage you have shown
may your glory and your fame be widely known.
and francis hughs and ray mccreesh you died unselfishly
and patsy o'hara and next in line is me
and all who lie behind me may your courage be the same
and i pray to god my life is not in vain.
oh but sad and bitter was the year of 1981
for everything i lost and nothing won."
John Barleycorn,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=180,"there was three kings into the east,
three kings both great and high,
and they hae sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn should die.
they took a plough and plough'd him down,
put clods upon his head,
and they hae sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn was dead.
but the cheerful spring came kindly on'
and show'rs began to fall;
john barleycorn got up again,
and sore surpris'd them all.
the sultry suns of summer came,
and he grew thick and strong:
his head weel arm'd wi pointed spears,
that no one should him wrong.
the sober autumn enter'd mild,
when he grew wan and pale;
his bendin joints and drooping head
show'd he began to fail.
his colour sicken'd more and more,
he faded into age;
and then his enemies began
to show their deadly rage.
they've taen a weapon, long and sharp,
and cut him by the knee;
they ty'd him fast upon a cart,
like a rogue for forgerie.
they laid him down upon his back,
and cudgell'd him full sore.
they hung him up before the storm,
and turn'd him o'er and o'er.
they filled up a darksome pit
with water to the brim,
they heav'd in john barleycorn-
there, let him sink or swim!
they laid him upon the floor,
to work him farther woe;
and still, as signs of life appear'd,
they toss'd him to and fro.
they wasted o'er a scorching flame
the marrow of his bones;
but a miller us'd him worst of all,
for he crush'd him between two atones.
and they hae taen his very hero blood
and drank it round and round;
and still the more and more they drank,
their joy did more abound.
john barleycorn was a hero bold,
of noble enterprise;
for if you do but taste his blood,
'twill make your courage rise.
'twill make a man forget his woe;
'twill heighten all his joy:
'twill make the widow's heart to sing,
tho the tear were in her eye.
then let us toast john barleycorn,
each man a glass in hand;
and may his great posterity
ne'er fail in old scotland!"
John O Dreams,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=181,"when midnight comes and people homeward tread
seek now your blanket and your feather bed
home comes the rover, his journey's over
yield up the nighttime to old john o'dreams
yield up the nighttime to old john o'dreams
across the sky, the sun is gone astray
tormorrow's cares are many dreams away
the stars are flying, your candle's dying
yield up the darkness to old john o'dreams
yield up the darkness to old john o'dreams
both man and master in the night are one
all things are equal when the day is done
the prince and the ploughman the slave and the freeman
all find their comfort in old john o'dreams
all find their comfort in old john o'dreams
when sleep it comes the dreams are rushing clear
the hawks of morning they cannot reach you here
sleep is a river, flow on forever
and for your boatman choose old john o'dreams
and for your boatman choose old john o'dreams"

""you're short did you say?
""can't afford it today?""
""what harm? you can pay at your leisure!""
so fill up your glass with brandy
too much sure you'd sure you'd think it's a shandy
i've money enought to pay for the stuff
and to sing an ould ballad i'm handy
i love an ould tap o the toe
and there's sport in the brandy ho ho!
now now don't ye spill it
good girl molly fill it
and her's to the bards that we know
and like those ould songsters bygone
let's have devilment, drinking and song
could one of yer try
a ballad by and by
to help a gay evening along"
John Williams,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=183,"when last i saw john williams the young man full or pride
his lovely bride of just 4 days stood shining by his side
he laughed and slapped me on the back
he said, ""boy oh can't you see?
i've seen the last of wind swept bogs and bogs the last of me.""
the peelers and the landlords and the risings of the moon
and if ever i return again 't will be too bloody soon
rich man poor man beggarman, wife
sailed away into the night
where they landed up no one knows
round and round the story goes
he said, ""i'll take my chances in far off new york town""
they say there's lots of work there and a good man can't stay down
and with my lassie by my side we'll build a better home
and when the sea trips over lads we never more will roam
so we said farewell upon the key there was nothin' left to do
but to pray for john, and his lovely bride and their dreams may all come true
how i envied you john williams and your lovely fair haired bride
to be sailing on that mighty ship across the ocean wide
for she's the finest liner that was ever built by man
and they say there's naught can sink her not even god's own hand
man's pride can be his own downfall as that great ship sailed from home
but i thought i heard the banshee's cry that chilled me to the bone  "

when goin' the road to wexford town, horoe, horoe,
i met a man of great reknown
he was clad in a suit of khaki brown,
he loved me once but now did frown,
johnnie i hardly knew ye.
with drums and guns etc., horoe, horoe
the english lords did woo you,
oh darling dear you look so queer,
oh johnnie i hardly knew you!
where is the bill that looked so fair etc.
where is the promised bill so fair,
in which my dead sons were to share,
you drove them forth and did not care,
since you their anguish would not share,
oh johnnie i hardly knew you!
you drove them forth to slay the hun,
yes every single mother's son,
though a million english slackers run,
and all for this precious bill you've won,
oh johnnie i hardly knew you!
you're worse than famine in the land,
you're worse than famine in the land,
with lords and ladies so fine and grand,
to finish the gaels you well have planned,
and leave for the saxon your native land,

Johnny Jump Up,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=185,"well,i'll tell you a story that happened to me
one day as i went out to youghal by the sea
the day it was hot, the sun it was warm
says i ""a quick pint wouldn't do any harm""
i went in and called for a bottle of stout
says the barman,""i'm sorry the beer's all sold out
try whiskey, young paddy, ten years in the wood""
says i, ""i'll have cider; i've heard that it's good.""
but i'll never, oh never, oh never again
if i live to a hundred or a hundred and ten
well i fell to the ground and i couldn't get up
after drinking the quart of the johnny-jump-up
after leavin' the third i came out by the yard
where i walked into brophy the big civic guard;
""come 'ere to me boy don't you know i'm the law?""
i upped with me fist and i shattered his jaw.
well he fell to the ground with his knees doubled up
'twas not i that hit him, but johnny jump-up
the next thing that i met down by youghal by the sea
was a cripple on crutches and he said to me
""i'm afraid for me life i'll be hit by a car
won't you help me across to the railwayman's bar?""
but after drinkin' a quart of the cider so sweet
he threw down his crutches and danced in the street.
well i went down the lee road a friend for to see,
they call it the madhouse in cork by the sea
but when i got there sure the truth i will tell
they had the poor bugger locked up in a cell
said the guard, testing him, ""say these word if you can:
'around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran.""
""tell them i'm not crazy, tell them i'm not mad
'twas only the sup of the bottle i had.
a man died in the union by the name of mcnabb
they washed him, they laid him outside on a slab
and after o'connor his measurements did take
his wife took him home for a bloody fine wake
well, about twelve o'clock and the beer it was high
the corpse he sits up and says he with a sigh
""i can't get to heaven, they won't let me up
'till i bring them a quart of johnny jump-up"
Johnny McEldo,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=186,"there was johnny mceldo and mcgee and me
and a couple two or three went on a spree one day
we had a bob or two which we knew how to blew
and the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
we visited mccann's mcilman's, humpty dan's
we then went into swan's our stomach's for to pack
we ordered up a feed which indeed we did need
and we finished it with speed but we still felt slack
johnny mceldo turned to red, white and blue
when a plate of irish stew he soon put out of sight
he shouted,""encore!"" with a roar for some more
that he never felt before such a keen appetite
he ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, ""what a cram""
but him we couldn't ram though we tried our level best
for everything we bought, cold or hot mattered not
it went down him like a shot and he still stood the test
he swallowed tripe and lard by the yard we got scared
we thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
we told him to give o're but he swore he could lower
twice as much again and more before he had his fill
""he's nearly supped a trough full of broth!"", says mcgrath
""he'd swallow a tablecloth if we don't hold him in""
mceldo began to groan and i moaned let's go home
and he wouldn't move a bone he just sat with a grin
when the waiter brought the charge, mceldo felt so large
he began to scowl and barge and his blood went afire
he began to curse and sware, tear his hair in dispair
and to finish the affair, called the shopman a liar
the shopman he drew out and no doubt he did clout
mceldo he kicked about like an old football
he bloodied all his clothes, broke his nose i suppose
he'd a finished him in a few blows in no time at all
mceldo began to growl and to howl by my soul
and he threw an empty bowl at the shopkeeper's head
he struck poor mickey flynn, peeled the skin off his chin
and a ruction did begin and we all fought and bled
the peelers did arrive, ""man alive"" for or five
at us they made a drive for us all to march away
we paid for all the mate, what we ate, stood a trait
and went home to ruminate on that spree that day"
Johnson's Motor Car,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=187,"it was down by brannigan's corner one morning i did stray.
i met a fellow rebel and to me he did say
he had orders from our captain to assemble at dunbar
but how were we to get there without a motor car.
oh barney dear be of good cheer i'll tell you what you'll do.
the specials they are plentiful but the i.r.a. are few,
we'll send a wire to johnson to meet us at stranrar
and we'll give the boys a jolly good drive in johnson's motor car.
when doctor johnson heard the news he soon put on his shoes
he said this is an urgent case, there is not time to lose,
he then put on his castor hat and on his breast a star,
you could hear the din going through glen fin of johnson's
motor car.
but when he got to the railway bridge, the rebels he saw there,
ould johnson knew the game was up for at him they did stare;
he said i have a permit to travel near and far,
to hell with your english permit, we want your motor car.
what will my loyal brethren think when they hear the news
my car it has been commandeered by the rebels at dunluce,
we'll give you a receipt for it, all signed by captain barr
when ireland gets her freedom, then you'll get your motor car.
well they put that car in motion and they filled it to the brim
with guns and bayonets shining, which made ould johmon grim.
then barney hoisted the sinn fein flag and it fluttered like a star,
and we gave three cheers for the i.r.a. and johnson's motor car."

we'll go no more a rovin', a rovin' in the night
we'll go no more a rovin' lad, the moon it shines so bright
we'll go no more a rovin'
he would not lie within the barn nor yet within the byre
but he would in the corner lie down by the kitchen fire
and so the beggar's bed was made with good clean sheets and hay
and down beside kithen fire, the jolly beggar lay  
the farmer's daughter she came down to bolt the kitchen door
and there she saw the beggar standin' naked on the floor
he took the daughter in his arms and to the bed he ran
""kind sir"" she said, ""be easy now you'll waken our good man!""  
""and so you are no beggarman you are some gentleman.
for ye have stole me maidenhead and i am quite undone""
""i am no lord i am no squire, a beggar's heart you've won.

said, ""go ye with the beggarman! me maidenhead and all!""  "

as you can plainly see
as he roved out one morning
in search of company

a fair maid he did see
come for one night and be my wife
oh come along with me
he called liquor of the best
and made such fortune play
""come have a drink and you will think
that it is our wedding day""
won't you come along with me love
come along with me
come for one night and be my wife
oh come along with me
he called for a candle
to light their way to bed
and when he had her in his arms
these words to her he said
""a sovereign i will give to you
for to embrace you charms""
and all that night the fair young maid
lay in the butcher's arms  
early the next morning
the shorman went his way
and then unto that fair young maid
these words to her did say
""that sovereign that i gave to you
please do not think me strange
that sovereign that i gave to you
would you gives me back me change?""
about 12 months later
he roved out once more
and went into that tavern where he'd often been before
he wan't in there very long
when the fair maid he did see
and she broght forth a baby 3 months old
and placed it on his knee.
well when he saw the baby
he began to curse and swear
and said unto the fiar young maid
""why did you bring him here?""
""well heis your own kind sir""
she said.""please do not think me strange
that sovereign that ye gave to me
well i gives ye back yer change!""

Jolly Rovin Tar,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=190,"ships may come and ships may go
as long as the sea does roll

it's the same old song

come along, come along
ye jolly ray boys
there's lots of grog in the jar
we'll plow the briney ocean
with the jolly rovin' tar
jack he then, he climbs the stairs
to some old boarding house
they'll welcome him with rum and gin
and feed him on port stout
he will spend and he won't end
till he's lying drunk on the ground
but when the money's gone
it's the same old song
get up jack jones! sit down!
jack he then all bent he'll sail
on down for new foundland
all the ladies in placentia there
they love that sailor man
he'll go to shore all on a tear
and he'll buy some girl a gown
but when the money's gone
it's the same old song
get up jack jones! sit down!
when jack gets old and weatherbeat
too old to roam about
they'll let him stop in some rum shop
till eight bells calls him out
then he'll raise his eyes
up to the skys singin'
""boys, we're homeward bound!""
but when the money's gone
it's the same old song
get up jack jones! sit down!"

to say goodbye
to one we love
to live your life

twilight welcomes you
your hands will toil
as you begin anew
the setting sun spreads
colors on the sky
the golden harvest waits
the fields are high
leaves of red and gold
ride on the wind
as for you a new life will begin
you made your mark
on those you know
with candied smiles
and eyes aglow
still angels smile
from high above
for those you touched
and those you love

Kelly from Killanne,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=195,"what's the news? what's the news? o my bold shelmalier,
with your long-barrelled gun from the sea?
say, what wind from the south blows his messenger here
with a hymn of the dawn for the free?
""goodly news, goodly news, do i bring, youth of forth,
goodly news do i bring, bargy man!
for the boys march at dawn from the south to the north
led by kelly, the boy from killanne!""
tell me who is the giant with the red curling hair,
he who rides at the head of the band?
seven feet is his height, with some inches to spare
and he looks like a king in command!
""oh, me boys, that's the pride of the bold shelmaliers,
the greatest of heroes, a man!
fling your beavers aloft and give three rousing cheers,
for john kelly, the boy from killanne!""
enniscorthy's in flames, and old wexford is won,
and the barrow tomorrow we cross.
on a hill o'er the town we have planted a gun
that will batter the gateways to ross!
all the forth men and bargy men march over the heath
with brave harvey to lead on the van;
but the foremost of all in that grim gap of death
will be kelly, the boy from killanne!
(slower)
but the gold sun of freedom grew darkened at ross
and it set by the slaney's red waves;
and poor wexford, stript naked, hung high on a cross
with her heart pierced by traitors and slaves!  (quicker and stronger now)
glory o! glory o! to her brave sons who died
for the cause of long-down-trodden man!
glory o! to mount leinster's own darling and pride:
dauntless kelly, the boy from killanne!"

Kevin Barry,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=197,"in mountjoy jail one monday morning
high upon the gallows tree
kevin barry gave his young life
for the cause of liberty
but a lad of eighteen summers
yet no one can deny
as he walked to death that morning
he proudly held his head on high
just before he faced the hangman
in his dreary prison cell
british soldiers tortured barry
just because he would not tell
the names of his brave companions
and other things they wished to know
""turn informer or we'll kill you""
kevin barry answered, ""no""
calmly standing to attention
while he bade his last farewell
to his broken hearted mother
whose grief no one can tell
for the cause he proudly cherished
this sad parting had to be
then to death walked softly smiling
that old ireland might be free
another martyr for old ireland
another murder for the crown
whose brutal laws may kill the irish
but can't keep their spirit down
lads like barry are no cowards
from the foe they will not fly
lads like barry will free ireland
for her cause they'll live and die"
Kilkelly Ireland,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=198,"kilkelly, ireland, 18 and 60, my dear and loving son john
your good friend the schoolmaster pat mcnamara's so good
as to write these words down.
your brothers have all gone to find work in england,
the house is so empty and sad
the crop of potatoes is sorely infected,
a third to a half of them bad.
and your sister brigid and patrick o'donnell
are going to be married in june.
your mother says not to work on the railroad
and be sure to come on home soon.
kilkelly, ireland, 18 and 70, dear and loving son john
hello to your mrs and to your 4 children,
may they grow healthy and strong.
michael has got in a wee bit of trouble,
i guess that he never will learn.
because of the dampness there's no turf to speak of
and now we have nothing to burn.
and brigid is happy, you named a child for her
and now she's got six of her own.
you say you found work, but you don't say
what kind or when you will be coming home.
kilkelly, ireland, 18 and 80, dear michael and john, my sons
i'm sorry to give you the very sad news
that your dear old mother has gone.
we buried her down at the church in kilkelly,
your brothers and brigid were there.
you don't have to worry, she died very quickly,
remember her in your prayers.
and it's so good to hear that michael's returning,
with money he's sure to buy land
for the crop has been poor and the people
are selling at any price that they can.
kilkelly, ireland, 18 and 90, my dear and loving son john
i guess that i must be close on to eighty,
it's thirty years since you're gone.
because of all of the money you send me,
i'm still living out on my own.
michael has built himself a fine house
and brigid's daughters have grown.
thank you for sending your family picture,
they're lovely young women and men.
you say that you might even come for a visit,
what joy to see you again.
kilkelly, ireland, 18 and 92, my dear brother john
i'm sorry that i didn't write sooner to tell you that father passed on.
he was living with brigid, she says he was cheerful
and healthy right down to the end.
ah, you should have seen him play with
the grandchildren of pat mcnamara, your friend.
and we buried him alongside of mother,
down at the kilkelly churchyard.
he was a strong and a feisty old man,
considering his life was so hard.
and it's funny the way he kept talking about you,
he called for you in the end.
oh, why don't you think about coming to visit,
we'd all love to see you again."

but man's faith can ne'er decline such god's wonders floating by

Kiss Me I'm Shitfaced,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=526,"i play in a band we're the best in the land
we're big in both chelsea and france
i play one mean guitar and then score at the bar
there's a line of chicks waiting for their chance
so come on now honey, i'll make you feel pretty
these other gals mean nothing to me
let's finish these drinks and be gone for the night '
cause i'm more than a handfull you'll see
[:] so kiss me i'm shitfaced
i'm soaked i'm soiled and brown
in the trousers she kissed me
and i only bought her one round
i can bench press a car i'm an ex football star
with degrees from both harvard and yale
girls just can't keep up i'm a real love machine
i've had far better sex while in jail
i designed the sears tower
i make two grand an hour
i cook the world's best duck flambe
i'll take the pick of the litter
girls jockey for me
i don't need these lines to get laid
[]
i'm the man of the night
a real ladies delight
see, my figure was chiseled from stone
one more for the gal then i'll escort her home
come last call, i'm never alone
i own a house on the hill with a red water bed
it puts hugh hefner's mansion to shame
with girls by the pool and italian sports cars
i'm just here in this dump for the game
[ x2]
ahh, who am i shittin'? i'm a pitiful sight
and i ain't all that bright
i'm definitly not chiseled from stone
i'm a cheat and a liar no woman's desire
i'll probably die cold and alone
but just give me a chance
cause deep down inside
i swear i got a big heart of gold
i'm a monogamous man
no more one night stands
come on, honey let me take you home ()"

we are gathered here before you, and our hearts are just the same
filled with joy at such a vision, as we praise your name
golden rose, queen of ireland, all my cares and troubles cease
as we kneel with love before you, lady of knock, my queen of peace
though your message was unspoken, still the truth in silence lies
as we gaze upon your vision, and the truth i try to find
here i stand with john the teacher, and with joseph at your side
and i see the lamb of god, on the altar glorified
golden rose, queen of ireland, all my cares and troubles cease
as we kneel with love before you, lady of knock, my queen of peace
and the lamb will conquer and the woman clothed in the sun
will shine her light on everyone

there blows a lily fair
the twilight gleam is in her eye
the night is on her hair
and like a love-sick lennan-shee
she has my heart in thrall
nor life i owe nor liberty
for love is lord of all
and often when the beetle's horn
hath lulled the eve to sleep
i steal unto her shieling lorn
and thru the dorring peep.
there on thy cricket's singing stone,
she spares the bogwood fire,
and hums in sad sweet undertone
the songs of heart's desire
her welcome, like her love for me,
is from her heart within.
her warm kiss is felicity
that knows no taint of sin.
and when i stir my soot to go,
'tis leaving love and light
to feel the wind of longing blow
from out the dark of night"

'till he came to an island of soft marshy gound
crying, ""comrades dearest comrades, do not venture in!

well early next morning willie's sister arose
and onto her mother's bedchamber did go
sayin', ""i had a sad dream 'bout willie last night.
he was clad in a shroud, in a shroud of snow white""
well later that evening willie's mother stood there
she was ringing her fingers and tearing her hair
saying woe to the hour young willie plunged in

i made my weary way,
through swamps and elevations
my tired feet did stray
until i resolved at sunset
some higher ground to win.
'twas there i met with a creole girl
by the lake of ponchartrain.
""good evening, fair maiden,
my money does me no good.
if it wan't for the allegators
i'd stay out in the wood.""
""you're welcome, welcome, stranger.
at home it is quite plain
for we never turn a stranger
from the lake of ponchartrain.""
she took me to her mother's home
and she treated me quite well;
her long black hair in ringlets
upon her shoulders fell.
i tried to paint her picture
but, alas, it was in vain
so handsome was that creole girl
by the lake of ponchartrain.
i asked her if she'd marry me
she said that ne'er could be;
she said she had a lover,
and he was on the sea,
she said she had a lover
it was true she would remain,
until he returned for the creole girl
by the lake of ponchartrain.
""adieu, adieu, fair maiden,
you ne'er shall see me more
and when you are thinking of the old times
and the cottage by the shore
and when i meet a sociable
with a glass of the foaming main
i'll drink good health to the creole girl
by the lake of ponchartrain."""
Lanigan's Ball,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=204,"in the town of athy one jeremy lanigan
battered away till he hadn't a pound
his father he died and made him a man again
left a farm with ten acres of ground
he gave a grand party for friends a relations
who did not forget him when come to the will
and if you'll but listen i'll make you're eyes glisten
of rows and ructions at lanigan's ball
six long months i spent in dub-i-lin
six long months doing nothin' at all
six long months i spent in dub-i-lin
learning to dance for lanigan's ball
i stepped out   i stepped in again
i stepped out   i stepped in again
i stepped out   i stepped in again
learning to dance for lanigan's ball
myself to be sure got free invitaions
for all the nice boys and girls i did ask
in less than 10 minutes the friends and relations
were dancing as merry as bee 'round a cask
there was lashing of punch and wine for the ladies
potatoes and cakes there was bacon a tay
there were the o'shaughnessys, murphys, walshes, o'gradys
courtin' the girls and dancing away
they were doing all kinds of nonsensical polkas
all 'round the room in a whirly gig
but julia and i soon banished their nonsense
and tipped them a twist of a real irish jig
oh how that girl got mad on me
and danced till you'd think the ceilings would fall
for i spent three weeks at brook's academy
learning to dance for lanigan's ball  
the boys were all merry the girls were all hearty
dancing away in couples and groups
till an accident happened young terrance mccarthy
put his right leg through miss finerty's hoops
the creature she fainted and cried 'melia murder'
cried for her brothers and gathered them all
carmody swore that he'd go no further
till he'd have satisfaction at lanigan's ball
in the midst of the row miss kerrigan fainted
her cheeks at the same time as red as a rose
some of the boys decreed she was painted
she took a wee drop too much i suppose
her sweetheart ned morgan all powerful and able
when he saw his fair colleen stretched out by the wall
he tore the left leg from under the table
and smashed all the dishes at lanigan's ball 
boy oh boys tis then there was ructions
myself got a kick from big phelam mchugh
but soon i replied to this kind introduction
and kicked up a terrible hullaballoo
old casey the piper was near being strangled
they squeezed up his pipes bellows chanters and all
the girls in their ribbons they all got entangled
and that put an end to lanigan's ball  "
Lark in the Morning (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=205,"the lark in the morning she rises off her nest
she goes home in the ev'ning with the dew all on her breast.
and like the jolly ploughboy, she whistles and she sings
she goes home in the ev'ning with the dew all on her wings.
roger the ploughboy, he is a dashing blade
he goes whistling and singing over yonder green glade
he met with pretty susan, she's handsome i declare
she is far more enticing than the birds all in the air.
one ev'ning coming home from the rakes of the town
the meadows they were green and the grass had been cut down
""if i should chance to tumble all in the new-mown hay
for it's kiss me now or never, love,"" this bonny lass did say.
when twenty long weeks they were over and were past
her mammy chanced to notice how she thickened 'round the waist.
""it was the handsome ploughboy,"" the maiden she did say
""for he caused me for to tumble all in the new-mown hay.""
here's health to young ploughboys wherever you may be

with a jug of good strong porter, you'll whistle and you'll sing,

for you are beautiful
and i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell

i heard there's a wicked war a blazing
and the taste of war i know so very well
even now i see the foreign flag a raising
their guns on fire as we sail into hell
i have no fear of death; it brings no sorrow
but how bitter will be this last farewell
refrain:
though death and darkness gather all about me
and my ship be torn apart upon the seas
i shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
in the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
and should i return safe home again to england (ireland)
i shall watch the irish mist roll through the dell"

i'll leave thee thou lone one to pine on the stem
since the lovely are sleeping go sleep now with them
thus kindly i scatter thy leaves o're the bed
where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead
so soon may i follow when friendships decay
and from love's shining circle the gems drop away
when tru hearts lie withered and fond one's are flown
oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?"

LeBron's Gone,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=519," take your throne, take your ego
pack up all your cool trends
pack up your pre-game talcum powder
and your mothers boyfriends
take the hopes and the dreams
for the self you revealed
take the reverend's support
and game fives highlight reel
drew carey could teach you what its like to be loyal
but you would prefer to proclaim you are royal
your support for the yankees was public and strong
then the midgies appeared as a sign you were wrong
you see karma has ways, they are powerful forces
to take down the mighty when theyre high on their horses
one test that your character might be artificial
was an espn king james hour special
its all about winnin
but you turned and you ran
you proved it cant happen when you are the man
youll choke again in the playoffs
and see if they hail you
youll discover your fathead
is shrinking in value
st. vincent, st. mary, you let them both down
couldnt win on our court now predictions abound
but the whammys upon you and i pray it sticks
as you build a new dynasty
brick by brick
and lets not forget the czar david stern
who thinks that dan gilbert has money to burn
lebrons tv show it was tacky or worse
youre just sorry that you didnt think of it first

there's owen in the pub
who will serve you tasty grub
or perhaps a pint of guinness with your name  c
pub life begins real soon
bob opens up at noon
he'll serve coffee if you need to clear the fog
you'll find he never judges
or holds bartender's grudges
if your order needs to be ""hair of the dog""  c
anna runs around the room
your meal will be here soon
her specialty is service while she smiles
she'll help you quench your thirst
through an obstacle course
she won't finish till she's clocked in 15 miles  c
cooks and servers who are grand
hear singers and great bands
try to wrap this awesome place around your head
peeping leaves or schussing snow
a premier place to go
and breakfast if your arse is out of bed   c
people come from land and sea
for the hospitality
if you've never been than you deserve a lash
patty, murray, sons mcgrath
come here once and you'll come back
and discover murray's quality mustache"
Leyden Girls O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=207,"i wrote this for margaret and helen leyden. the story is based on the truth.
back in olden times
when the irish had a passing
they'd empty out the parlor
and wake them in their home
they had a nice supply
of food and drinks there
for the tasting
and they'd open up the doors and the mourners they would come
oh those leyden girls were irish
they were daring they were risky
they'd put there saddest faces on
and wear black irish lace
they'd say a quick prayer for the corpse
and then drink irish whiskey
and they wouldn't know a soul
dead or living in the place
the first thing every morning they would check the local paper
looking for an irish name
amongst the fresh deceased
and when they'd see a murphy or o'toole
they'd plan their caper
and they'd mark their social calendar for a mortuary feast
the girls were most excited when
the paper came on thursday
they'd thank their lucky stars above
to see an irish name
with refrigeration what is was
they'd wake your man on friday
well a girl without a weekend date
well that's an awful shame  
when death would strike the upper crust
a shaker or a mover
they'd rent a horse and carriage
to take them to the door
the risk was oh so very great that they would be discovered
so they'd roll their veils
down o're their face
and drink whiskey through a straw 
the girls had such a social life
that they would never wed
this social life was guananteed
with the next fatality
they'd make sure the drinks
were cold and stiff in honor of the dead
and they'd tip the corpse a dollar
for his hospitality"

Lily the Pink,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=209,"now here's the story--a little bit gory
a little bit happy--a little bit sad--
lily the pink and her medicinal compound
and how it drove her to the bad.
ebenezer thought he was julius caesar
and so they put him in a home
and then they gave him medicinal compound
and now he's emperor of rome.
we'll drink a drink a drink
to lily the pink the pink the pink
the saviour of the human race
for she invented medicinal compound
most efficacious in every way.
ripley twinger, the opera singer,
would take a glass to save his straining neck
he rubbed his tonsils with medicinal compound
now is it him or memorex?
johnny hammer had a t-t-terrible stammer
he could hardly s-s-say a word
and so they g-g-gave him medicinal compound
now he's s-s-seen but never heard.   
uncle paul, he was very small, he
was the shortest man in town
he rubbed his body with medicinal compound
now he weighs only half a pound.
lily died and went up to heaven
all the church bells, they did ring.
she took with her medicinal compound;
hark the herald angels sing."
Limerick is Beautiful,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=210,"oh then limerick is beautiful as everybody knows
the river shannon full of fish beside that city flows
'tis not the river nor that fish that preys upon my mind
nor with the town of limerick i have any fualt to find
'tis not for limerick that i sigh though i love her in my soul
though times will change and friends will die and man will not control
no not fro friends long passed away or days forever flown
but that the maiden i adore is sad in garryowen
oh she i love is beautiful and world wide is her fame
she swells down by the rushing tide and erie is her name
and dearer than my very life her glances are to me
the light that guides my weary soul across the stormy sea
i loved her in my boyhood and now in manhood's noon
the vison of my life is still to dry thy tears aroon
i'd sing unto the tomb or dance beneath the gallows tree
to see her on the hills once more proud, passionate and free"
Limerick Rake,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=211,"i am a young fellow that's easy and bold,
in castletown conners i'm very well known;
in newcastle west i spent many a note
with kitty and molly and mary.
my parents rebuked me for being such a rake
and spending my time in such frolicsome ways,
but i ne've could forget the good nature of jane,
agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.
my parents, they reared me to shake and to sow,
to plough and to harrow, to reap and to mow;
but my heart was too airy to drop it so low,
i set out on a high speculation.
on paper and parchment they taught me to write
and in euclid and grammar they opened my eyes,
but in multiplication, in truth, i was bright,
agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.
to quarrel for riches i ne'er was inclined,
for the greatest of misers must leave them behind;
i'll purchase a cow that will never run dry
and i'll milk her by twisting her horn.
john damer of shronel had plenty of gold
and devonshire's treasure was twenty times more,
but he's laid on his back among nettles and stones,
agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.
if i chance for to go to the market at croom,
with a cock in my hat and my pipes in full tune,
i am welcome at once and brought up to a room
where bacchus is sporting with venus.
there's peggy and jane from the town of bruree,
and biddy from bruff and we all on the spree,
such a combing of locks as there was about me,
agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.
there's some say i'm foolish, there's more say i'm wise,
for love of the women i'm sure 'tis no crime;
for the son of king david had ten hundred wives
and his wisdom is highly recorded.
i'll till a good garden and live at my ease
and the women and children can partake of the same,
if there's war in the cabin, themselves are to blame,
agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.
and now for the future i mean to be wise,
and i'll send for the women that treated me kind;
and i'll marry them all on the morrow, by and by
if the clergy agree to the bargain.
and when i'm on my back and my soul is at peace
the women will crowd for to cry at my wake,
and their sons and their daughters will utter their prayers
to the lord for the sake of their father."
Limerick You're My Lady,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=212,"limerick you're my lady
your shannon waters tears of joy that flows
the beauty that surrounds you
i think about you love where e're i go
while waking in the arms of distant waters
a new day finds me far away from home
and limerick you're my lady
the one true love that i have ever known
the days when you and i spent endless days of fun
in winter snows and summer's golden sun
we fished in silver streams, the fabric of my dreams
was fashioned by your lovliness
so now i have to say  
a gift that time has made to travelers on their way
seeking outthe beuaty of our land
a shrine where children play
the bells ring out to say
that's god that we're alive to see the freedom of each day "
Limericks from the 2002 Ireland Trip,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=213,"this year's trip yielded the creative genius of many a passenger.
our 40 were divided into 4 ""clans"" to assist in the attendence taking.
they were:
the o'carnsies clan
the o'hurley clan
the o'kay clan
the o'no clan
all was proceeding smoothly until 6 people ""defected"" to form their own clan. when their spokesperson, bruce wilhelm made the declaration they were forming their own clan, he also offered a challenge to the remaining 4 that we come up with at least one limerick. here's the first.
fact:
our coach driver and tour guide george flynn had a penchant for saying ""oh jay sus!""
amy mckeon:
our clan start is of great interest
it started over many pints of guinness
in o'garvey's began
off with it we ran
and now we are known as o'jaysus!
the o'kay response from ben demott:
there once were 6 traitors so bold
who left their own clans oh so cold
on further reflection
we welcome defection
of any so easily sold
&amp;
so this is our feeling so true
with them we are totally through
they can have their new clan
and we don't give a damn
and nobody's saying ""boo hoo!""
fact:
there was a great stir from the masses about the defection and the limericks began pouring in...
tony trost:
the o'jaysus clan tried an end run
they marched to the tune of a different bodhran
by the o'kay's were booed
and will eventually be sued
come monday they will see ""jonny cochran""
fact:
the grand prix was in killarney while we were in town with all those hot rods
bruce wilhelm:
a great guy named george drove our bus
he maneuvered the coach with no fuss
when a prix driver would pass
george would not stomp on the gas
he would simply sigh ""oh jaysus!""
fact: we visited lisdoonvarna for a lunch stop. we had only a given amount of time until we would roll again. some of us wound up with very slow service in the pubs.
lorna wilhelm:
as we toured lisdoonvarna one day
seeking food in a desperate way
at the ritz we sat down
for the ""best craic in town""
but the service was on time delay
for you see the poor barmaid was busy
our orders galore made her dizzy
some folks just gave up
crossed the street for some sup
while the rest finally ate in a tizzy
fact: we arrived at shannon before our coach so we had some time for breakfast and a pub stop in the airport
tim mckeon:
our flight from new york just landed
on the ground at the airport in shannon
we were in too early
but instead of getting surly
we had a pint sooner than we'd been plannin'
fact:
the hurley family was with us and inspite of their following limerick, the children were great travelling companions. their 3 children michael 13, erin 12 and ryan 9 came up with this one.
there once was a lady named julie
we kids at times were quite unruly
in ireland we ran and we raced
we rushed her at such a great pace
that's why in the morning, her pillow is so droolie
ryan's observation:
there once was a beer named guinness
some people think it's for fitness
he thinks it tastes like crud
she thinks it tastes like mud
but you always want more when you're finished!
from erin (award winner!!)
one day george was sick, sniffling and sneezing
his mom said he was outdoors when it was freezing
george sat blowing his nose
which turned red as a rose
i think it was punishment for all of his jaysusing
fact: our medieval banquet was at dunguaire castle where we had the largest most boisterous group. dan flanagan used some poetic license here:
our banquet was held at bunratty
where mead was poured not paddy
after downing a few at the table
we knew we would soon be able
to drive the servers &amp; dinner guests batty
tony trost:
george flynn was the name of the driver we had
touring around making cows mad
to the mountainside we did go
the highland sheep were really a show
but what a surprise when they called george d-a-a-a-d
fact:
when we toured the ""ring of kerry"" we managed almost the entire trip without stopping in a pub. finally a rest area was ahead and we anxiously waited to have a pint.
ben demott:
if you wonder why some guys are sad
and some even possibly mad
we came 'round the ring
""there's moll's gap!"" we did sing
but there wasn't a drop to be had!
fact: the night i performed in the joshua tree in cork city, some of the local gals took a fancy to john gaffney. john lingered behind after we all left for the night to get back on the coach and they tried to have their ""way with him!"" john also temporarily lost a piece of luggage the next day.
bruce wilhelm:
there was an irish lass named mags
who wore clothing to highlight her sags
after the anthem was sung
she slipped gaffney the tongue
it's no wonder john can't find his bags.
fact:
tony trost wore a baseball cap with a propeller on the top. he also fell asleep in the joshua tree during the evening.
bruce wilhelm:
there once was a clan named o'no
who tried to keep tony in tow
from wherever we sat
could be seen that damned hat
so we voted to stow him below!
here are some of my own observations:
tony saw ireland and shopped her
ever bottle cap, cork and a stopper
in the pub he reclined
after he drank and dined
but never once lost his hat helicopter
fact: one night mindy brady and sara defrancisco met up with a group of rugby players. as the evening progressed, the team all wound up naked playing cards in their hostel for all to see.
rugby men can be rough
when playing and drinking and stuff
for sara and mindy
the night grew quite windy
when the lads all wound up in the buff
fact:
george remarked that stacey wadsworth's suitcase was so heavy that she must have rocks in it
a rock totin' tourist named stacey
had boulders in her black suitcasey
when george had to load 'em
down dropped his scrot...
if it lands on the floor could be pricey!
fact:
jim tuskes stepped out of the shower and couldn't believe the floor was heated. while standing there fresh out of the shower in his altogether he called his wife wendy exclaiming,""honey, you've got to come in and feel this!""
jim from the shower had to roar
to feel heat from the tiles in great score
then wendy he beckoned
to include her he reckoned
to feel how it raised from the floor!
fact:
lisa wasyln decided to cuddle a one week old lamb at one of the scenic stops on the ""ring"". when she put the animal down, he had left a present on her shirt.
little lambs were lisa's delight
she scooped one and held it so tight
she must have spooked him
for when he did poop then
her chest was all covered in shite!
fact:
each night john gaffney would go out to the afterhours clubs and always manage to find an all night fast food place supermacs or hillbillies.
a hamburger guzzler named john
in the clubs would go out with the throngs
but then every night
with a keen appetite
have a burger and fries and ding dongs
fact:
ed dailey tracked down a friend from college, jim hagen he hadn't seen in 25 years while we were in kerry. jim went to ireland to play music and entertain. we met them for lunch one day.
for 25 years ed missed his man
entertainer and schoolmate and ham
ed never lost sleep
o're the hills counting sheep
to locate his friend on the lam
a generic observation after so many people shopped ireland:
for ireland's a place with no topping
you can go place to place without dropping
there are women with cash
who make quite a dash
for an olympic sport they all call shopping!
newly discovered!
amy laid on the blarney floor slab
to acquire a wee gift of gab
but the stone wouldn't give it
and amy was livid
because she has blarney more than it had
a former clan member named lorna
stayed up well past four in the morna
from bed wouldn't rise
couldn't open her eyes
from the drinks of last nite they were pourin' her
there once was a family named hurley
with 2 parents, 2 boys and a girly
there was never a gripe
morning, noon, even night
until the morning we got up so early
""irish travelling kay"" on a tour bus was rollin'
throughout ireland with ben she was strollin'
when george shifted gears
music fell on his ears
when kay said you're better'n mick nolan
two trip members here dan &amp; steve
a martini web each of them weaved
in the mornin' tried eatin'
but a path started beatin'
to the loo for a gin flavored heave!
a limerickian sonnet ( from the o'no clan)
to ireland we came
sweet wendy was lame
kathy our leader
a great little greeter
has tony and jan to explain
at ""dun-something"" castle
right by the bay
jerry's hat went flying
and john saved the day
and then there is jimmy
always so droll
but unfortunately he's
never under control
leonora and carmela the sisters panone
and italians true blue
are happy to announce that
tony's not one too
and that explains the eight of us
i have to say.
it was a great trip. i hope you enjoy the momentos"
Little Beggarman,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=214,"well i am a little beggarman, a begging i have been
for three score years in this little isle of green
i'm known along the liffy from the basin to the zoo
and everybody calls me by the name of johnny dhu
of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
for when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
he can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
but to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo
i slept in a barn one night in currabawn
a shocking wet night it was, but i slept until the dawn
there was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
and the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo
who did i waken but the woman of the house
with her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
she began to frighten and i said boo
sure, don't be afraid at all, it's only johnny dhu
i met a little girl while a walkin out one day
good morrow little flaxen haired girl, i did say
good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
with your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo
i'll buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
and a nice young lady i'll go courting by and by
i'll buy a pair of goggles and i'll color them with blue
and an old fashioned lady i will make her too
so all along the high road with my bag upon my back
over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
with holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo
o i must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
the fire is all raked and now tis out of light
for now you've heard the story of my auld rigadoo
so good and god be with you, from auld johnny dhu"
Little Hills of Duna (The),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=504,"when i was a little lad
with folly on my lips
fain was i for journeying
all the seas in ships
but now across the southern swell
every dawn i hear the little streams of duna running clear
when i was a young man
before my beard was grey
all to ships and sailormen i gave my heart away
but i'm weary of the sea wind
i'm weary of the foam
and the little stars of duna call me home
thanks to joanne o'callahghan &amp; her da"
Liverpool Lou,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=215,"when i go a-walking, i hear people talking
school children playing, i know what they're saying
they're saying you'll grieve me, that you will deceive me
some morning you'll leave me all packed up and gone
oh liverpool lou, lovely liverpool lou
why can't you behave just like the other girls do?
why must my poor heart be following you
stay home and love me, my liverpool lou
the songs from the river they keep saying ever
that i should forget you like i'd never met you
tell me their song, love, was never more wrong love
just say i belong love to my liverpool lou"
Liverpool Lullaby,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=216,"oh you are a mucky kid,
dirty as a dustbin lid
when he finds out the things you did
you'll get a belt from your da
oh you have your father's nose
so crimson in the dark, it glows
if you're not asleep when the boozers close
you'll get a belt from your da
you look so scruffy lying there
strawberry jam tufts in your hair
though in the world you haven't a care
and i have got so many
it's quite a struggle everyday
living on your father's pay
'cause the bugger drinks it all away
and leaves me without any
although we have no silver spoon
better days are coming soon
now nellie's working at the lune
and she gets paid on friday
perhaps one day we'll have a bash
when little ones provide the cash
we'll get a house in knotty ash
and buy your dad a brewery
oh you are a mucky kid,
dirty as a dustbin lid
when he finds out the things you did
you'll get a belt from your da
oh you have your father's face
you're growing up a real hard case
but there's no one can take your place
go fast asleep for mammy"
Living Next Door to Alice,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=435,"sally called, just got the word
she said, i suppose you heard ´bout alice
well i rushed to the window and i looked outside
and i could hardly believe my eyes
it´s a big limosine moved up into alice´s drive
oh i don´t know why she´s leaving
or she´s gonna go
i guess she´s got reasons
but i just don´t want to know
cause for 24 years i´ve been living next door to alice
24 years just waiting for a chance
to tell her how i feel it
and maybe get a second chance
now i got to get used to not living next door to alice
grew up together, two kids in the park
carved our initials deep in the bark me´n and alice
now she walks through the door
with her head held high
and just for a moment i caught her eye
as the big limosine pulled slowly
out of alice´s drive
and sally called back, and asked how i felt
she said, i know, how to help get over alice
she said: now alice is gone,
but i´m still here
you know i´ve been waiting for 24 years
than the big limosine disapeared"
Loch Lomond,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=468,"by yon bonnie banks,
and by yon bonnie braes,
where the sun shines bright on loch lomond,
where me and my true love
were ever want to gae,
on the bonnie, bonnie banks of loch lomond.
oh! ye'll take the high road and i'll take the low road,
and i'll be in scotland afore ye;
but me and my true love
will never meet again
on the bonnie, bonnie banks of loch lomond.
'twas then that we parted in yon shady glen,
on the steep, steep side of ben lomond,
where in purple hue
the highland hills we view,
and the moon coming out in the gloaming.
oh! ye'll take the high road and i'll take the low road,
and i'll be in scotland afore ye;
but me and my true love
will never meet again
on the bonnie, bonnie banks of loch lomond.
the wee birdie sang
and the wild flowers spring,
and in sunshine the waters are sleeping,
but the broken heart it kens
nae second spring again,
tho' the waeful may cease frae their greeting. "
Lord Nelson,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=217,"lord nelson stood in pompous state,upon his pillar high
and down along o'connell street he casta wicked eye
he thought how this barbaric race had fought the british crown
yet they were content to let him stay right there in dublin town!
so remember brave lord nelson, boys,
he has never known defeat
and for his reward they stuck him up
in the middle of o'connell street!
for many years, lord nelson stood, and no one seemed to care
he would squint at dan o'connell who was standin right down there
he thought the irish love me or they wouldnt let me stay,
all except that band of blighters that they call the ira!
and then in nineteen sixty six, on march the seventh day,
a bloody great explosion made lord nelson rock and sway!
he crashed, and dan o'connell cried,in woeful misery
now twice as many pigeons will come and shit on me!
(last time) so remember brave lord nelson,boys,
he has never known defeat!
and for his reward they blew him up
in the middle of o'connell street!"
Lord Of The Dance,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=218,"i danced in the morning
when the world was begun
i danced in the moon

and i danced on the earth
at bethlehem i had my birth
refrain:dance, dance wherever you may be""i am the lord of the dance,"" said he"" i'll lead you all wherever you may be i will lead you all in the dance'"" said he
i danced for the scribe
and the pharisee
but they would not dance
they wouldn't follow me
i danced for the fisherman
for james and john
they came with me
and the dance went on refrain
i danced on the sabbath
and i cured the lame
the holy people said it was a shame
they whipped and they stripped
and they hung me high
they left me there
on the cross to die  refrain
i danced on a friday
and the sky turned black
it's hard to dance
with the devil on your back
they buried my body
and the thought i'd gone
but i am the dance
and i still go on   refrain
they cut me down i lept up high
i am the light
that will never, never die
i'll live in you
if you live in me
""i am the lord of the dance,"" said he.

Lovely Leitrim,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=219,"last night i had a pleasant dream i woke up with a smile
i dreamt that i was back again in dear old erin's isle
i thought i saw lough allen's banks in the valleys' down below
it was my lovely leitrim where the shannon water's flow
i stood enchanted at the scene of grandeur and of light
the next i left for carrick town before the dark of night
i passed sheemore that fairy hill where flowers wildly grow
and i passed the grave of finn mccool where the shannon water's flow
the next i saw was fenagh town with her ancient abbey walls
the preaching of her holy monks re-echoes through her halls
i stood with reverence on the spot reluctant for to go
from the town of saints and sages where the shannon water's flow
i've travelled far from this great land from the east and to the west
but of all the islands i have seen i love my own the best
and if ever i return again there's one place i will go
it will be my lovely leitrim where the shannon water's flow"
Macushla,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=446,"macushla! macushla!
your sweet voice is calling,
calling me softly, again and again,
macushla! macushla!
i hear it in vain.
macushla, macushla,
your white arms are reaching,
i feel them enfolding,
caressing me still.
fling them out from the darkness,
my lost love, macushla,
let them find me and bind me
again, if they will.
macushla! macushla!
your red lips are saying
that death is a dream,
and love is for aye,
then awaken, macushla,
awake from your dreaming,
my blue-eyed macushla,
awaken to stay.

Maggie,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=220,"i wandered today to the hills maggie
to watch the scene below
the creek and the creaking old mill maggie
as we used to long long ago
the green grove is gone from the hills maggie
where first the daisies sprung
the creaking old mill is still maggie
since you and i were young
2
they say that i'm feeble with age maggie
my step are much slower than then
my face is a well written page maggie
and time all alone was the pen
they say we have outlived our time maggie
as dated as the songs that we've sung
but to me you're as fair as you were maggie
when you and i were young"
Maggie May,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=221,"oh maggie, maggie may, they are taking you away
and you'll never cruise down lime street anymore
for you robbed so many whalers and rolled so many sailors
you're gone to a far off distant shore
oh it's well that i remember when i first met maggie may
she was cruisin' up and down old canaan place
and she had a figure finer, than thefastest ocean liner
and me being a sailor i gave chase
next mornin' when i 'woke, all sad and stoney broker
no trousers vest or suitcase could i find
when i asked her where they were, she said, ""my very good sir.
they're down at abbey's pawnshop number nine!""
to the pawnshop i did go but no clothes there did i find
so the policeman came and took that gal away
and the judge he guilty founder her, of robbing a homeward bounder
and paid her passage off to botany bay"

the fair and fickle young thing she knew not what to say

said he, ""my pretty fair maid how can you say so
look down on yonder valley whaere my crops do gently grow
look down on yonder valley where my horses and my plough
are at their daily labour for the the maid of the sweet brown knowe
""if they're at their daily labour kind sir it's not for me
for i've heard of yuor behavior, i have indeed!"" said she
""there is an inn where you call in, i've heard the people say
where you rap and call and pay for all and go home at the break of day!""
""if i rap and call and pay for all, the money is all me own
for i'll never spend your fortune for i hear that you have none
you thought you had my poor heart broke in talking with me now
and i left her where i found her at the foot of the the maid of the sweet brown knowe"
Mairi's Wedding,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=223,"step we gaily on we go
heel for heel and toe for toe
arm and arm and on we go
all for mairi's wedding
over highways up and down murtyl green and braken brown
pass the sheelings through the town, all for sake of mairi  
plenty herring, plenty meal, plenty peat to fill her creel
plenty bonny barnes and well that's the hope for mairi 
cheeks as bright as rowans are, brighter far than any star
fairer than them all by far, is my darlin' mairi  "
Maloney Wants A Drink,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=580,"when eve was in the garden, adam climbed an apple tree,
he went aloft up to the top, to see what he could see.
he gazed in awe of what he saw, it made the poor man grieve.
for patrick john maloney stood there, whispering to eve...
`ah kiss me love, and miss me love
and dry your bitter tears.
my loving you`ll remember now
for many, many years.
be happy love, be satisfied, i left you in the pink.
there`s many a man that wants a bride.
maloney wants a drink.`
salome danced for paddy, taking off her seven veils.
salome said, `maloney, that`s a trick that never fails.`
malone put salome`s oily clothing in a sack.
`i`ll run along now to the pawn, and bring your bundle back.`
`ah kiss me love, and miss me love
and dry your bitter tears.
my loving you`ll remember now
for many, many years.
be happy love, be satisfied, i left you in the pink.
there`s many a man that wants a bride.
maloney wants a drink.'
from london to nebraska, and from glasgow to hong kong,
from cardiff to alaska, from peking to saigon,
wherever girls are lonely, i know that in his role,
it`s there you`ll find maloney, a waiting to console...
`ah kiss me love, and miss me love
and dry your bitter tears.
my loving you`ll remember now
for many, many years.
be happy love, be satisfied, i left you in the pink.
there`s many a man that wants a bride.
maloney wants a drink."
Man From Mulingar (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=224,"you may talk and boast about your fenian's and your clans
and how the boys from county cork beat up the black and tans
and view a little codger who came out without a scar
his name was paddy mulligan, the man from mulingar
and the peelers chased him out of connemara
for beating up the valiant scion o'hara
and he came to ballymote he stole the parson's goat
and sold him to the bishop down in ardagh
seven hundred peeler's cousin's henchmen
the king sent out an order for to lynch him
when patrick came to dublin par he sold his motorcar
and gave it to the i.r.a. brigade in mulingar
on easter monday when the boys did hear the bugle's sound
paideen raised the flag of war down in his native town
first he went to make his peace with dear old father maher
then went out and blew the barricks up and wrecked half mulingar 
when ireland takes her place among the nations of the world
and her flag of orange white and green to the four winds is unfurled
when you read the roll of honor you will find marked with a star

Manhattan Stand O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=510,"theres a place in north ohio
where people come to play
with sparky and bob sampson
and the king of all d. kane
just walk on thru the back door
for a time that beats the band
with a genuine, bonafide mystified, certified
manhattan stand
kevin o cried, genius!
just tell me where and when
dennis said saturday 2 oclock
but kevin would make it at ten
the whole thing started at 5 am
when bob pitched up the tent
and set it in the front yard
wheres theres no overhead or rent
then kat showed up with poster board
and markers just in time
then dirty harry dennis said,
go ahead and make my sign.
then to move our product
she had the slogan of the year
with one big word manhattans
and in smaller letters (beer)
but the drinks we werent sellin
they would all be free
with a simple cash donation
to a cancer charity
people came from miles around
and business it was boomin
when barely just an hour in
the cops theyd come a loomin
youre sellin booze in lyndhurst
you know that it aint right
the phones ringin off the hook
clear down to mayfield heights
with an explanation given
we still thought thered be a collar
when dennis said, before you leave
can you give us a dollar?
then better yet, before you leave
and youre still on this beat
would you send out an amber alert
for a feller on this street?
mike jamison is missing
and thats our greatest fear
weve been sitting here all day
with tubs of ice cold beer
you might think these exploits
are from spanky and our gang
but the real king of manhattans
is clevelands own jim lange
it wasnt even easter sunday
but the drinks were running pure
so well thank you all
for coming to the bracer for the cure"

Mary of the Curling Hair,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=444,"1. my mary of the curling hair, the laughing teeth, and bashful air,
our bridal morn is dawning fair,
with blushes in the skies.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan

2. wake, linnet of the osier grove!
wake, trembling, stainless, virgin dove!
wake, nestling of a parent's love!
let moran see thine eyes.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan
3. i am no stranger, proud and gay,
to win thee from thy home away,
and find thee, for a distant day,
a theme for wasting sighs.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan
4. but we were known from infancy,
thy father's hearth was home to me,
no selfish love was mine for thee,
unholy and unwise.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan
5. and yet, (to see what love can do!)
though calm my hope has burned, and true,
my cheek is pale and worn for you,
and sunken are mine eyes!
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan
6. but soon my love shall be my bride,
and happy by our own fire-side,
my veins shall feel the rosy tide,
that lingering hope denies.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan

the laughing teeth and bashful air,
our bridal morn is dawning fair,
with blushes in the skies.
suil suil suil a gra suil, go socair and suil to buan
my love! my pearl! my own dear girl!
my mountain maid, arise!"
Master McGrath,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=227,"eighteen sixty-nine being the date of the year
the waterloo sportsman, they all did appear
to win the great prize and to bear it away
never counting on ireland and master mcgrath
and when they arrived there in london town
the great english sportsman they did gather round
one of the gentlemen gave an, ""ha ha
is that the great dog you call master mcgrath?""
lord lurgon stepped forward and he said, ""gentlemen,
if there are any among you have money to spend,
for your great english greyhound i don't care a straw.
five thousand to one upon master mcgrath.""
mcgrath he looked up
and he wagged his old tail
informing his lordship
""sure i know what you mean.
don't fear noble brownlowe
don't fear them agraw.
we'll soon tarnish their laurels!""
said master mcgrath
well the rose stood uncovered,
the great english pride
her master and lorship
were there by her side.
then they led her them away
and the crowd cried, ""hurrah!""
for the pride of all england and master mcgrath.
as rose and the master,
they both ran along,
""well i wonder,"" said rose,
""what took you from your home.
you should have stayed there i
in your irish domain
and not come to gain laurels on albion's plains.""
""i know,"" said mcgrath,
""we have wild heather bogs,
but you'll find in old ireland
we have good men and dogs.
lead on, bold britannia,
give none of your jaw;
snuff that up your nostrils,""
said master mcgrath.
the hare she led on,
just as swift as the wind,
he was sometimes before her
and sometimes behind
then he jumped on her back
and he waved his old paw;
""three cheers for old ireland,"" said master mcgrath.
i've known many greyhounds
that filled me with pride
in the days that are gone
and it can't be denied,
but the greatest and the bravest
the world ever saw
was our champion of champions,
brave master mcgrath"
McAlpine's Fusiliers,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=228,"as down the glen came mcalpine's men with their shovels slung behind them.
it was in the pub that they drank their sub or down in the spike you'll find them.
we sweated blood and we washed down mud with quarts and pints of beer.
but now we're on the road again with mcalpine's fusiliers.
i stripped to the skin with darky finn down upon the isle of grain,
with horseface toole i learned the rule, no money if you stop for rain.
for mcalpine's god is a well filled hod with your shoulders cut to bits and seared
and woe to he who looks for tea with mcalpines fusiliers.
i remember the day that the bear o'shea fell into a concrete stair,
what horseface said, when he saw him dead, well it wasn't what the rich call prayers.
""i'm a navy short,"" was his one retort that reached unto my ears,
when the going is rough, well you must be tough, with mcalpine's fusiliers.
i've worked till the sweat near had me beat with russian, czech and pole,
at shuttering jams up in the hydro dams, or underneath the thames in a hole,
i grafted hard and i got me cards and many a ganger's fist across me ears.
if you pride your life, don't join, by christ, with mcalpine's fusiliers."

the largest barn

of this i give my word
but the ""shingles"" couldn't stop him
and he never did get ""board""
the girls in town would watch him
and say,""that stud's off center!""
to them he'd only sneer and say,
""i'll be done by winter!""  
they say of his work ethic
he had a strong foundation
he went ahaed a built the
largest barn across the nation
his promise on the level
for the task he finally finished
he removed his hat
and wiped his brow and said,

some friends and i
in a pulic house
were playing dominos one night
into the room the barman came
his face a ghastly white
what's up says brown
have you seen a ghost
have you seen your aunt myriah
""oh my aunt myriah be buggered!"" says he
""the bloody pub's on fire!""
""on fire!"" says brown
""what a bit of luck.
everybody follow me.
into the cellar if the fire's not there
we'll have a rare old spree!""
so we all went down after good old brown
the booze we could not miss
and we weren't there 5 minutes or more
when we were all half pissed
and there was brown, upside down
lappin' up the whiskey on the floor
booze booze the firemen cried
as they came knockin' at the door
don't let them in till it's all mopped up
somebody shouted ""mcintyre""
and we all got blue blind
paralytic drunk
when the old dun cow caught fire
then smith went over
to the port wine tub
gave it a few hard knocks
started taken' off his pantaloons
likewise his shoes and socks
""hold on!"" says brown
""you can't do that!
we can't have that in here!
don't go washin' your trotters
in the port wine tub
when we've got all this lite beer""
and then there came an awful crash
half the roof gave way
we were drowned in the fireman's hose
but still we were going to stay
so we got some tacks
and our old wet slacks
and nailed ourselves inside
and we sat there swallyin'
pints of stout
till we were bleary eyed!"

what an elegant time at the christening we had
of mc sorely's two beautiful twins.
now mr. mc sorely jumped up in a rage
and threatend mr mullins his life
he said oh mr mullins, i'll break the first man
who dare lay a hand on me wife.

and the murphys pitched into the flynns
they fought like the devil
turned over the beds

breaking news
theyre there to get you jumpin
and get your heart a pumpin
while theyre shortening everybodys fuse
are they here to tell a story
or embellish for the glory
make normal people feel a bit more manic?
if theres one thing i despise
to announce one person dies
to incite  people who are more likely to panic
its amazing how low they will resort
is their job to make news or just report?
special graphics on the screen
and scary music sets the scene
and tally numbers for the newly rigor mortis

heedless of the crying children
dragging fathers from their beds
beating sons while helpless mothers
watched the blood flow from their heads

Men of the West,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=234,"when you honor in song and in story
the names of the patriot men,
whose valor has covered with glory
full many a mountain and glen,
forget not the boys of the heather
who rallied their bravest and best
when ireland was broken in wexford
and looked for revenge to the west.
i give you the gallant old west, boys,
where rallied our bravest and best
when ireland lay broken and bleeding;
hurrah for the men of the west!
the hilltops with glory were glowing
'twas the eve of a bright harvest day,
when the ship we'd been wearily waiting
sailed into killala's broad bay.
and over the hills went the slogan
to awaken in every breast
the fire that has never been quenched, boys,
among the true hearts of the west.
killala was ours ere the midnight,
and high over ballina town
our banners in triumph were waving
before the next sun had gone down.
we gathered to speed the good work, boys
the true men from near and afar;
and history can tell how we routed
the redcoats through old castlebar.
and pledge me the stout sons of france, boys,
bold humbert and all his brave men,
whose tramp, like the trumpet of battle,
brought hope to the drooping again.
since ireland has caught to her bosom
on many a mountain and hill
the gallants who fell, so they're here, boys,
to cheer us to victory still.
though all the bright dreamings we cherished
went down in disaster and woe,
the spirit of old is still with us
that never would bend to the foe.
and connaught is ready whenever
the loud rolling tuck of the drum
rings out to awaken the echoes
and tell us the morning has come."

then up spoke the cook of our gallant ship
and a crazy old butcher was he

cause i memorized the fishes' dictionary-o
and before i'd marry you, i'd marry-o
a guernsy cow from the dairy-o
or eat a poison berry-o
and wind up with fishes' dysentery-o
poor mermaid of ontario
it was more than she could bear-e-o
so she cried for a day then swam away
with a yuppie little guppie named gary-o
now they're a happy pair-e-o
cause he's a millionaire-e-o
on his yacht 'neath lake st. claire-e-o
they cuddle in a cozy chair-e-o
and listen to his underwater stereo
and that big mouth bass named larry-o
married a cow from the dairy-o
she fed him a poison berry-o
and he wound up in the fishes' cemetery-o
and that's the whole scenario"
Merry Ploughboy   a.k.a. Jolly Ploughboy,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=237,"we're off to dublin in the green in the green,
where the helmets glisten in the sun
where bayonets flash and rifles clash
to the echoes of a thompson gun.
oh i am a merry ploughboy
i plough the fields all day,
but then the thought came to my head
that i should run away
i've always hated slavery since the day that i was born
and i'm off to join the i.r.a. i'm tomorrow morn. 
i'll leave behind my pick and spade
i'll leave behind my plough
i'll leave behind my old grey mare
i'll no longer need them now
i'll take my short revolver
and my bandoller of lead
and do or die i can try
to avenge my country's dead   
i'll leave behind my mary
she's the one that i adore
i wonder if she'll think of me
when she hears those cannons roar
and when the war is over and dear old ireland's free
i'll take her to the church to wed
and a rebel's wife she'll be  "

and i'll quickly tell to you
of a young girl i admired,
called katy donohue
she was fair and fat and forty

that whenever i came in at the door
you could hear her mammy say
johnny get up from the fire,
get up and give the man a seat
can't you see it's mr. maguire
and he's courtin' your sister kate
ah, you know very well he owns a farm
a wee bit out of the town

you'd hear the ould one say
johnny come up to the fire, come up,

Mick McGilligan,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=424,"i'm a gallant irishman i've a daughter mary anne
she's the sweetest, neatest, colleen in the isle
though she can't now purchase satin
she's a wonder at bog latin in a fluent, fascinatin' sort of style
when she's sellin' fruit or fish
sure, it is her fondest wish
for to capture with her charm some handsome man
ah! no matter where she goes
sure, everybody knows
that she's mick mcgilligan's daughter mary anne
: she's a darlin', she's a daisy
and she's set the city crazy
though in build, and talk, and manner, like a man
when me precious love draws near
you can hear the people cheer
for mick mcgilligan's daughter mary anne
alternative : she's me darlin', she's me daisy
she damn near drives me crazy
she's got hairs upon her chest like any man
and you know she's on the rocks
when she's wearin' cotton socks
mick mcgilligan's daughter, mary ann
she's so frolicsome and hearty
she's the life of every party
she's invited to the hoolies, wan and all
for her big explosive laugh
would cheer up a sick giraffe
och! a noble heart is b'aten 'neath her shawl
sure tis aisy to be seen that she is no beauty queen
and her double chin is steam-rolled every day
and her eyebrows they are shifted
and her face is being lifted
though who is goin' to lift it, i can't say
the concertina she can play in a captivatin' way
and wan single semi quaver never misses
arrah! while you'd reckon four
they'd be dancin' on the floor
tangos, polkas, waltzes, wan-steps, and schottisches
middle notes play with her nose
tappin' time with her big toes
while the company admire her figure vast
them musicianers mad jealous
sure they're long haired dreamy fellows
and they know me daughter's tone is unsurpassed
she has fine peroxide thresses
and some gorgeous wan-piece dresses
she can use her feet delightful in a dance
any reel or rink-a-fawder
doesn't cause her any bother
or them foreign tarantellas straight from france
like a wartime armoured sloop
she gives wan terrific whoop
and comes sailin' through the room, accordin' to plan
then yeh'll hear the m.c. shout '
gents and ladies please look out
here's mick mcgilligan's daughter mary anne
at elocution she is great
sure 'the abbey' and 'the gate'
they were clamourin' for to have her on the stage
but me daughter's so refined
all their offers she declined
and the managers all are in a towerin' rage
at hollywood, likewise all them film-actin' guys
are rampageous to get mary anne to stay
but she won't leave lover jim
'cos she idolises him
and it's comin' soon, me daughter's weddin' day
mary anne has got a voice
that would mark a lark rejoice
a glorious high sultana, clear and strong
thrush and linnet stop their singin'
when me daughter is beginin'
for they know that somethin', somewhere, has gone wrong
her low notes as loud as thunder
nearly tear your brain asunder
they go whistlin' through the air like twelve inch shells
sure no depth charge, bomb, or blitz
can be said to equal this
for the atmosphere is filled with shrieks and yells
tho' she's nearin' twenty stone
she a charm just all her own
she's as graceful as a hippy-pot-a-mus
on her broad expansive face
smiles of welcome we can trace
when she scurtinises everyone of us
we've a hooley every year
when her birthday's dhrawin' near
but achone! mavrone! a pain is in me heart
for i'm goin' to lose me daughter
for another wan has bought her
and i know with mary anne i have to part
her finance's name is jim
he is wiry, tall, an' slim
he tarries at the milk bar all day long
but me cushla dove delights in his many glorious fights
every single man for miles has heard the gong
tho' not massive or not bold
he is feared be young and old
nature built him on a most original plan
only wan alone he fears
and he hastily disappears
when he sees me little baby, mary anne
ach! the weddin' is tomorrow
and a suit i've got to borrow
i must have me father's watch and chain as well
and on michael's hill i'll get
a tall hat and tie, you bet
and a pair of spats to make me quite a swell
then i'll give me daughter anne
to the care of her good man
while i'm dhrownded in confetti and in rice
and at the breakfast after
we'll have song, and dance and laughter
and a gross or two of stout ought to suffice"

in the ranks of death you will find him
his father's sword he has girded on
and his wild harp slung behind him
""the land of song,"" said the warrior bard,
""tho all the world betray thee
one sword at least thy ranks shall guard
one faithful harp shall praise thee""
the minstrel fell but the foreman's chain
could not bring his proud sould under
the harp he loved never spoke again
for he tore it's chords asunder
he said, ""no chains shall sully thee.
the sould of love and bravery
thy songs were made for the pure and free
they shall never sound in slavery!"""

just dig that bloody seam
though they drain their bodies underground

they're drinkers, they're liars but they're men

you've heard of the duke of gloucester, the dirty old imposter
he got a mot and lost her, up the furry glen.
he first put on his bowler and he buttoned up his trousers,
and he whistled for a growler and he says, ""my man""  
you've heard of the dublin fusileers, the dirty old bamboozileers,
they went and got the childer, one, two, three.
oh, marching from the linen hall there's one for every cannonball,

now when the czar of russia and the king of prussia
landed in the phoenix park in a big balloon,
they asked the polismen to play ""the wearin' of the green""
but the buggers in the depot didn't know the tune.
so they both went up to  
now the queen she came to call on us, she wanted to see all of us
i'm glad she didn't fall on us, she's eighteen stone.

Moonlight in Mayo,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=243,"it was just a year ago today i left old erin's isle
my heart was throbbin in the soft light of my colleen's smile
in all my dreams i seem to hearher sweet voice soft and low
i know she's waiting where we said goodbye in old mayo
for two irish eyes are shining
and an irish heart is pining
and when i kissed her and caressed her
in the gloaming long ago
loving irish arms will press me
and true irish love caress me
and sweet irish lips will bless me
when it's moonlight in mayo
her irish eyes like beacons shine all in the darkest night
i know the sweet love beams below will always fill the world with light
the roses of her cheeks will lend enchantment to the sea
and when shamrocks wear the dew i'll wed my sweet colleen "

i spent all my money on whiskey and beer
i'll go to some hollow and set up my still
and i'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill   
i'll go to some hallow in this country
ten gallons of wash i can go on a spree
no women to follow the word is all mine
and i love none so well as i love the moonshine  
oh moonshine oh moonshine oh how i love thee
you killed my ould father but will you try me

oh it's breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine

i'd swim to the bottom and drink my way up

Mother,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=246,"she gave me life and taught me to live
she gave me love and taught me how to give
she's the greatest example of courage i've known
and i hope she is proud of the seed she had sewn
and all of the times she held my hand
then the world was too big for her little man (and my problems were grand)
and when i was weak she would fight in my stead
and when i was weary she cradled my head
i was shielded and guarded by the power of love
and all of the good things a mother's made of
and all that i needed she gave me each day
and i know it's a debt i could never repay
when i'm faced with life's troubles she makes them her own
while she's had to bear all her crosses alone
and if it's not enough to do all that she can
than she'd lay down her life greater love hath no man
god knows she's had more than her share of pain
she still looks for the rainbow each time it rains
and if i could write webster's definition of love
it would only say, ""mother, a gift from above.""
now that (when) i'm grown with my own little ones
(it will clear up for me)
it's much clearer to me all the things you have done
and i thank god each day for all that you do
and for all that i am i will always love you"

i kiss the dear fingers so toil worn for me

Mountains of Mourne,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=248,"oh molly this london's a beautiful sight
where the people are workin' by day and by night
they don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat
but there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street
at least when i asked them that's what i was told
so i took up my hand at this diggin' for gold
but for all that i found there i might as well be
where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea
i believe that when writing one wish you'd expressed
as to how the fine ladies of london are dressed
well if you believe me when asked to the ball
faith, they don't wear no tops to their dresses at all
oh, i've seen it myself and i tell you in truth
i can't tell if they're bound for a ball or a bath
don't go startin' those fashions now molly machree
where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea
you remember young peter o'laughlin of course
well now he is here at the head of the force
i saw him one day i was crossing the strand
and he stopped the whole street with one wave of his hand
and there we stood talking of days long gone
while the whole population of london looked on
but for all his great power he's wishin' like me
to be back where the dark mourne sweeps down to the sea
i saw england's king from the top of a bus
still i don't know him still he claims to know us
and though by thesaxon's we once were oppressed
still i cheered god forgive me i cheered with the rest
and since that he's visited erin's green shore
we've been much better friends than we've been heretofore
when we get what we want we're as quiet as can be
where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea
there are beautiful girls here-oh, never you mind
with beautiful shapes nature never designed
and lovely complexions all roses and cream
but o'laughlin remarked with regard to the same
that if at those roses you venture to sip
the colours might all come away on your lip
so i'll wait for the wild rose that's waiting for me
where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea."

in the days when i was courtin' i was never tired resortin'
from the ale house and the play house and many's the house beside

Mullingar Heifer (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=250,"in dublin's fair city where fine people dwell
their fortunes would take me too long for to tell
there's one millionaire in the city 'tis true
but he isn't irish he's only a jew
the people of limerick they got a fine name
their hams and their bacon are well known to fame
their sausages too are the finest of meat
while the people of dublin eat only pig's feet
old mcguire of clonmel was that fond of his bed
his poor wife he nearly drove off of her head
at last for the the villian she did prove a match
for she gave him twelve duck eggs and told him to hatch
the kilkenny lads are fine rovin' blades
and make a good match for the kilkenny maids
and when they get married they all wear silk hats
to rear up the kittens of the kilkenny cats
a belfast girl said a blond i'd like to be
so she bought a bottle at a swell pharmacy
something exploded her peroxide
she thought she was dead but she only was dyed
when a galway girl got married in the days long dead
she got for her fortune a fine feather bed
when a girl now gets married they think it enough
to give her a lipstick and a fine powder puff
there was an elopement down in mullingar
so sad to relate the pair didn't get far
""oh fly"" said he, ""darlin and see how it feels!""
but the mulingar heiffer was beef to the heels
a barber with trim would get gay with the girls
who came to his parlour to shingle their curls
his wife caught him giving a permanent wave
now the poor fellow lives in a permanent grave
a cork man who stammered was once getting wed
and he practiced beforehand the words to be said
""will you take this woman?"" the parson did press
and he had to say ""no"" for he couldn't say ""  y..y..yyy..yye..ssssss"""
Murphy's Corned Beef Extravaganza,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=531,"here's a song for my friends matt, kerry, katie and mary frances (murph)
now here's a little story
you'll find it pretty good
about an irish party
in an italian neighborhood
the guests are mostly irish
with an occasional costanza
in north providence at murphy's
corned beef extravaganza
they knew the proper formula
to throw a successful bash
add 100 pounds of brisket
whole potatoes never mash!
put it all into a satellite dish
and a fishin' pole you'll bring
because it doubles as a koi pond
on the 1st day of the spring
and never forget the time
the propane burner wouldn't heat
and murphy looked us in the eye
he would not admit defeat
he said, 'gather all good people.'
there was something he could learn us
when he took the thermocouple
right out of his household furnace
corned beef and irish music
were flowing through the air
when a bunch of neighbors showed up
with gold chains in their hair
we knew they would be peaceful
we knew they wouldn't pounce
especially since gold is sellin'
for about 2 grand an ounce
clap the irish rover early
if you want it to sound the best
if you wait until the sunset
it will surely sound a mess
the beer you'll all be drinkin
won't be comin' from milwaukee
at the corned beef extravaganza
at murphy's on pensaukee"

if a fellow can't drink when he's livin'
how the hell can he drink when he's dead

if a fellow can't drink when he's livin'
how the hell can he drink when he's dead"
Music Man O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=252,"there is a place down in my soul
a dwelling place that is your home
a shelter for your mem'ries when you roam
i hear the wind and i hear your sighs
a laughing breeze can light up my skies
the lyrics of your song are kept inside
let me be your music man
your melody, your song
let me be your music man
you curiosity can light a flame
a shining sun screaming out your name
your warm embrace can brighten up my day
bridge
grasp the light and climb up the rays
prepare the world for another sunny day
the lyrics swim inside your head
they toss and turn and give you no rest
set them free they'll put you to the test
the day will come you'll surprise yourself
you'll learn to dance just climb off your shelf
you're strong enough, the world will seek your help

My Dad O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=253,"you watched me grow
throughout the years
you saw the sorrow and the tears
your gentle hand
showed me the way
to do right from day to day
i tried to bring you pride and joy
with all the love that you employed
remember still, the times we had
and i will thank the lord above
you're my dad
now that i am grown
i can see and understand
the reasons for your ways
that made me who i am
none can ever know
the joy and pain we shared
this love i have for you
can't be compared
though i'm a young and steadfast man
i still can take you by the hand
i see the age around your eyes
they keep your sorrows in diguise
although in time we both will part
you will keep beating in my heart
remember still, the times we had
and i will thank the lord above
you're my dad"
My Donegal,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=400,"the lights of london
are far behind
the thoughts of homeland
are crowding my mind
familiar places
come into view
i see my home now,
soon i'll see you
this is my home land
the place i was born in
no matter where i go
it's in my soul
my feet may wander
a 1000 places
but my heart will lead me
back home to my donegal
we'll talk to the old folks
for they're getting on
and treat them to late nights
and sing a few songs
we'll talk of the neighbors
and life in the town
there's so much to tell them
the days fly around  
and then tomorrow
we'll take a walk
down to st. mary's
to a sheltered spot
we'll kneel and pray there
for the one's who have gone
and hope that they're proud of
their wandering son"

three little cosy rooms with bath and ""welcome"" on the mat;
it's five pounds down and two a week, we'll soon be out of debt
it's all complete except they haven't brought the cradle yet.
molly dear, now did you hear what all the neighbors say
about the hundred sovreigns you have safely stowed away?
they say that's why i love you. ah but molly, that's a shame
if you had only ninety-nine, i'd love you just the same."

for beauty sure she reigns supreme

on the lovely hills of clare
as i walked along with my sweet love
one evening at the fair
her eyes they shone like silver streams
her long and golden hair
and i have won the heart of one
my lovely rose of clare
as we walked down by the riverbank
watched the shannon flowing by

sing songs for you and i

to all so true and fair

from scenes i roamed a boy
and long ago the hour, i know
i first saw illinois
not time nor tide nor water wide
could wean my heart away
but straight and true 'twill fly to you
my own dear galway bay
my chosen bride is by my side
her brown hair silver-grey
our daughter rose as like her grows
as april dawn to day
our eldest son, our chosen one
his father's pride and stay
with gifts like these i'd live at ease
beside you galway bay
by shore and creek both grey and bleak
the rugged rocks abound
but sweeter green the grass between
than grows on irish ground
so friendhip fond all else beyond
and love to live always
bless each dear home beside your foam
my own dear galway bay
had i youth's blood and hopeful mood
and heart of fire once more
for all the gold the earth could hold
i'd never leave your shore
i'd live content whatever god sent
midst neighbors old and grey
and leave my bones 'neath churchyard stones
beside you galway bay
the blessings of a poor old man
be with you night and day
the blessings of a poor old man
whose heart will soon be clay
'tis all the heaven i ask of god
upon my dying day
my soul to soar forever more
above you, galway bay"
My Son,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=259,"my son, you were the seed of life in me

with pride, i watched you grow up

my son, you gave my simple life its key
through you i see god's love and mystery
you build up my life with your sweet music
it's written in the song, this melody belongs
to you and me my son
my son, i taught you everything i know
for soon, one day i'll have to let you go
i would gladly die, if it saved you from the heartache
the fear and all the bad breaks
that tear your world apart
my son, you faced the truth and you stood tall
but now we face the hardest truth of all
i must say goodbye, but you must go on living
and when my life is throughm i'll always be with you
my one and only son....
i watch you now with pride
what more is there to life
than you and me my son?"

as i sing of my lover, the premium stout
oh guinness, oh guinness you stood up to time
invented and brewed since 1759
enjoyed in all nations
and shipped round the world
and semi instrumental in guys meeting girls
if you want to live well this is it!
science and doctors found it's benefits
vitamins and minerals good food for your mind
and many less calories than lagers and wines
oh guinness, oh guinness you stood up to time
invented and brewed since 1759
right here in my pint glass is where you belong
my shows are more interesting and so are my songs
folks make friends and converse everyday
2 or 3 pints and there's plenty to say
less alcohol than beer, that's the buzz
quite instrumental in avoiding the fuzz
oh guinness, oh guinness you stood up to time
invented and brewed since 1759
guinness for strength for years that's the poop
but new information, it prevents brewer's droop"
My Wild Irish Rose,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=261,"if you'll listen, i'll sing you a sweet little song,
of a flower that's now drooped and dead,
yet dearer to me, yes, than all of its mates,
tho' each holds aloft its proud head.
'twas given to me by a girl that i know,
since we've met, faith, i've known no repose,
she is dearer by far than the world's brightest star,
and i call her my wild irish rose
my wild irish rose,
the sweetest flow'r that grows,
you may search ev'rywhere,
but none can compare
with my wild irish rose.
my wild irish rose,
the dearest flow'r that grows,
and some day for my sake,
she may let me take
the bloom from my wild irish rose.
they may sing of their roses which, by other names,
would smell just as sweetly, they say,
but i know that my rose would never consent
to have that sweet name taken away.
her glances are shy when e'er i pass by
the bower, where my true love grows;
and my one wish has been that some day i may win
the heart of my wild irish rose."
Nancy Miles,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=506,"nancy was a tinker girl who roamed the country roads
and i will tell you how she came to be a legend in her time
and the reason that i've come to know well the tinker told me so
who better than to pass to me the tale of nancy myles
nancy's father tinker dan was a poor but honest man
drove a horse drawn caravan all through the emerald isle
when nancy was no more a child
dan he didn't have to toil
men would come from far and wide to pay for nancy myles
there's pretty girls in magazines
movie stars and beauty queens
nancy was the prettiest girl a man could ever see
and the gleam of love in her eyes when she'd look and you and smile make you feel that you were just the man she'd long to she
before the age of twenty-one a hundred men had come and gone none of them could win the gleam of love that was in her eyes
any man who loved her then never was the same again
his memory was haunted with thoughts of nancy myles
in every town and village too the fame of nancy grew and grew
soon her name was spoken at many a campfire's side
and in ballislough on horse fair day
when tinker men would have their say
many a fight was fought to win the court of nancy myles
i hope that you don't get me wrong
nancy was the sweetest one
heart so full of kindness and as charming as her smile
she was known through out the land the queen of all the tinker clan
'twas the dream of every man to marry nancy myles
before the age of thirty-one a thousand men had come and gone
none of them could win the gleam of love that was in her eyes
every man who loved her then never was the same again
his memory was haunted with thoughts of nancy myles
then there came the saddest day nancy's father passed away
the loss it grieved her dearly and her heart was filled with pain
family friends and courting men never say her smile again
a change had taken place within the heart of nancy myles
before the age of forty-one nancy she had come and gone
they searched the country over not a trace of her could find
nancy's memory will live on as long as tinker men are born
proudly they will the song of tinker nancy myles"
Nancy Spain,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=262,"of all the stars that ever shone
not one does twinkle like your pale blue eyes
like golden corn at harvest time your hair
sailing in my boat, the wind gently blows and fills my sail
you sweet scented breath is everywhere
no matter where i wander i'm still haunted by your name
the portrait of you beauty stays the same
standing by your ocean wond'ring where you've gone
if you'll return again
where is the ring i gave to nancy spain
daylight peeping through the curtains
of the passing nighttime is your smile
the sun in the sky is like your laugh
come back to me nancy and linger for just a little while
since you left these shores i know no peace or joy  
on the day in spring when snow starts to melt and streams to flow
with the birds i'll sing to you a song
in a while i'll wander down by bluebell grove
where wild flowers grow
and i'll hope my lovely nancy will return  "
Nancy Whiskey,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=263,"whiskey, whiskey, nancy whiskey, whiskey whiskey nancy-o
well i'm a weaver a coulton weaver, i'm a rash and rovin' blade
i love silver in my pockets and i follow the rovin' trade 
as i came down through glasgow city, nancy whiskey i chanced to smell
i walked in and sat down beside her, seven long years i loved her well 
the more i kissed her the more i loved her, the more i kissed her the more she smiled,
soon i forgot my mother's teaching, nancy soon had me beguiled 
as i rose early on one morning to slake my thirst it was my need,
i tried to rise but i was not able, nancy had me by the knees 
so i'll go back to the coulton weavin' i'll surely make those shuttles fly,
for i made more at the coulton weavin' than e're i made at the rovin' trade 
so come all you weavers you coulton weavers come all you weaver's where're you be
please beware of nancy whiskey, she'll ruin you like she ruined me "
Nell Flaherty's Drake,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=264,"oh, my name it is neil, quite candid i tell,
and i lived in coote hill, which i'll never deny,
i had a large drake, and i'd die for his sake,
which my grandmother left me, and she going to die;
he was wholesome and sound; he weighed twenty pound,
and the universe 'round i would rove for his sake.
bad luck to the robber, be he drunk or sober,
that murdered nell flaherty's beautiful drake.
his neck it was green, most fit to be seen,
he was fit for a queen of the highest degree,
his body so white, it would give you delight,
he was fat, plump and heavy, and brisk as a bee;
my dear little fellow, his legs, they were yellow,
he would fly like a swallow, and swim like a hake.
until some dirty savage, to grease his white cabbage,
most wantenly murdered my beautiful drake.
may his pig never grunt, may his cat never hunt,
may a ghost always haunt him in the dead of the night,
may his hen never lay, may horse never nay,
may his goat fly away like an old paper kite;
may the flies and the fleas may the wretch ever tease,
may the piercing march breeze make him shiver and shake,
may the hump of a stick raise the lumps fast and thinck,
of the monster that murdered nell flaherty's drake.
may his cock never crow, may his bellows ne'er blow,
and a-pot or po, may he never have one,
may his cradle not rock, may his box have no lock,
may his wife have no smock to shield her back bone,
may his duck never quack, and his goose turn quite black
and pull down the turf with his long yellow beak.
may scurvy and itch, not depart from the breech,
of the monster that murdered nell flaherty's drake.
may his pipe never smoke, may his teapot be broke,
and to add to the joke may his kettle not boil,
may he lay in the bed 'till the moment he's dead
may he always be fed on lob-scouse and fish oil,
may he swell with the gout, may his grinders fall out,
may he roar, bawl and shout, with the horrid toothache.
may his temples wear horns, and all his toes corns,
the monster that murdered nell flaherty's drake.
may his spade never dig, may his sow never pig,
may each hair on his wig be well thrashed with a flail,
may his door have no thatch and his roof have no thatch,
nay his turkey not hatch, may the rats eat his meal,
may every old fairy fiom cork to dunleary,
dip him in snug and easy in river or lake,
that the eel and the trout may dine on the snout,
of the monster that murdered nell flaherty's drake.
may his dog yelp and growl with hunger and cold,
may his wife always scold 'till his brain goes astray,
may the curse of each hag, that e'er carried a bag,
alight on his nag till his beard it turns grey,
may monkeys still bite him, and man-apes affright him,
and everyone slight him asleep or awake,
may weasels still gnaw him, and jackdaws still claw him,
the monster that murdered nell flaherty's drake.
then all the good news l have to diffuse,
'tis for peter hughes, and blind peter mcfree,
there's big nosed bob manson, and buck-toothed ned hanson,
each man has a grandson of my darling drake,
my fellow had dozens of nephews and cousins,
and one i must get or my heart it will break,
to keep my mind easy or else l'll run crazy,
so this ends the song of nell flaherty's drake."
Never Knowing if the Third Time is the Charm,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=555,"how can you ever know
when its time to fall
what if the times not right
when you get the call
time could be right for anything
so what would be the harm
never knowing if the 3rd time is the charm
history is blistering
recalling all the years
deserving what could lie ahead
and blow away the fears
time could be right for anything so what can be the harm
never knowing if the 3rd time is the charm
there are so many lives youve touched
with your loving ways
i see how you can give so much
youre selfless all the days
i know you miss the ones you love
when you are far apart
still theres plenty room for more love in your heart
historys no mystery
but what will lie ahead
just hoping that the path will change
from where the past has lead
time could be right for anything
so what could be the harm
never knowing if the 3rd time is the charm"

glory-o to the men and the women laid to rest

Night That Paddy Murphy Died (The),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=266,"the night that paddy murphy died
is a night i'll never forget
some of the boys got loaded drunk
and they ain't been sober yet
as long as the bottle was passed around
every man was feelin' gay
and o'leary came with the squeezebox
and the music for to play
that's how they showed
their respect for paddy murphy
that's how they showed
their honor and their pride
they said it was a sin and shame
and they winked at one another
and every drink in the house was full
the night pat murphy died
mrs. murphy sat in the corner
pourin' out her grief
when kelly and his gang
came tearing down the street
they went into an empty room
and a bottle of whiskey stole
and kept that bottle with the corpse
to keep that whiskey cold  
at 2 o'clock in the morning
they'd emptied out the jug
doyle lifted the icebox lid
to see poor paddy's mug
they changed the clocks
so mrs. murphy couldn't tell the time
and at quarter after 2
we argued it was 9  
they emptied out the jug
but still they had a thirst
the next thing thay had done
well, you'll think it was the worst
and mrs. murphy fainted
when the news fell on her ears
when they scraped the ice
right off the corpse
and put it in their beers 
than we stopped the funeral hearse
outside sundance saloon
we all went in at half past 8
and staggered out at noon
we went up to graveyard
so holy and sublime
and realized when we got there
we'd left the corpse behind  "
Nightingale,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=267,"and they kissed so sweet and comforting
as they clung to each other
they went arm in down the road
like sister and brother.
they went arm in down the road
'till they came to a stream,
then they both sat down together love
to hear the nightingale sing.
as i was a-walking one morning in may
i saw a young couple in love did the stray
and the firstone was a pretty maid so sweet and so fair
and the second one was a soldier and a brave grenadier. 
then out of his knapsack, he drew a fine fiddle
and he played her such a merry tune that you ever did hear,
yes he played her such a merry tune that the valleys did ring
and they both say down together love to hear the nightingales sing. 
o come, said the soldier, 'tis time to give o'er
o no, said the maiden, please play one tune more.
i do like your playing, and the touching of the long string
and to see the pretty flowers grow, hear the nightingale sing. 
now i'm going to india, for seven long years
drinking wines and strong whiskey instead of strong beers
but if i ever return again, it will be in the spring
then we'll both sit down together, love, and hear the nightingale sing. 
now, said the fair maid, come, soldier, marry me.
o no, said the soldier, how ever can that be?
for i've a nice little wife at home in my own count-e-ry
and she is the smartest little woman that your eyes ever see. "

OBrien Has No Place To Go,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=505,"now, dennis o'brien has three daughters fine,
the fairest young girls on the block;
and between you and me, every night after tea,
to o'brien's the boys would all flock.
young mickey clancey stepped in to see nancy,
tim mccann stepped in to see rose;
and young mickey kelley stepped in to see nell,
with a plea to her father she'd go.
don't go into the front room, dad,
nancy's in there with her caller;
daddy dear, won't you stay out here,
rose has her friend in the parlour.
don't go into the kitchen, dad,
i'll be out there with my beau;
now, since all of his girls have got steady young men,
sure o'brien has no place to go.
last saturday night, o'brien got tight,
and he says to himself, now we'll see;
if three young galoots, dressed up in dude suits,
make a wandering fool out of me.
out went mccann on o'brien's brogan,
mickey kelley and clancey got sore;
they went over the stoop like an acrobat's troupe,
now o'brien will hear this no more.
don't go into the front room, dad,
nancy's in there with her caller;
daddy dear, won't you stay out here,
rose has her friend in the parlour.
don't go into the kitchen, dad,
i'll be out there with my beau;
now, since all of his girls have got steady young men,
sure o'brien has no place to go."
Ode to Beer,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=269,"d'oh, the stuff that buys me beer

Offaly Rover,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=270,"a rover i have been and a rover i will stay
but to that faithful county i will return some day
uibh fhaile how i love you with your heather scented air
silently the peaceful brosna calls her sons from far and near
oh kinnitty i long to see
when the woodbine's in full bloom
or stroll the fields around ferbane hear the wild birds in full tune
at clonmacnoise i see you
onto banagher we'll stray
where the fishermen will drink and tear of the ones that got away
though dead are still in exile
are some friends i used to know
still i must pass killoughy
where great sportmen are laid low
by croghan hilli see you
where in childhood i did play
so adieu to you beloved slieve bloom
i must be on my way
pile the brown turf on the fire bring the keg in from the barn
let the blacksmith sing his rebel song and the poacher tell his yarn
come close my friends and neighbors fill your glasses to the brim
as we toast our offaly heros from the heather, hill and glen"
Old Black Rum,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=271,"and the old black rum's
got a hold on me
like a dog wrapped 'round my leg
and that old black rum's
got a hold on me
will i live for another day hey
will i live for another day?
i drank 16 doubles for the price of one
tryin' to find the courage
to talk to the one
i asked her for a dance
not a 2nd glance
my night had just begun
when i drink to the father and the holy ghost
kneeling at the alter
of my nightly post
so i'll raise a glass
not the first or last
come join me in this toast  
well the queen of george st
is just walking by
walking on by with some guy who don't care
that she stood in line
since half past nine
and spent 3 hours on her hair
well her friend is looking at me
with an evil grin
i'm afraid a bloody ruction
will soon begin
i must have said something
to the georgetown queen
and the boys are joining in  
so i drank all of my money
and i slept out in the rain
everyday is different
but the nights are all the same
on the old black rum
you'll never see the sun
but you know i'm going
to do it again  "
Old Bog Road,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=272,"my feet are here on broadway
this blesses harvest morn
but oh the ache that's in them
for the spot where i was born
my weary hands are blistered
from work in cold and heat
and oh to swing a scythe today
through fiels of irish wheat
had i the chance the wander back
or own a king's abode
'tis soon i'd see the hawthorn tree
by the old bog road
my mother died last sprintime
when ireland's fields of green
the neighbors said her waking
was the finest ever seen
there were snowdrops and primroses
piled up beside her bed
and ferran's church was crowded
when her funeral mass was said
but here was i on broadway
and bitter was my load
when they carried out her coffin
down the old bog road
when i was young and innocent
amy mind was ill at ease
through dreaming of america
and gold beyond the seas
och, sorra take their money
'tis hard to get that same
and what's the world to any man
when no one speaks his name?
i've had my day and here i am
and bitter is my load
a long 3000 miles away from the old bog road
there was a decent girl at home
who used to walk with me
her eyes were soft and sorrowful
like moonbeams on the sea
her name was mary dwyer
but that was long ago
and the ways of god are wiser than
the things a man may know
she died the year i left her
and bitter was my load
i'd best forget the times we met
on the old bog road
och, life's a weary puzzle
past finding out by man
i take the day for what it's worth
and do the best i can
since no one cares a rush for me
what need a man to moan
i go my way and draw my pay
and smoke my pipe alone
each human heart must know it's grief
though little be it's load
so god be with old ireland
and the old bog road"
Old Dun Cow,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=273,"some friends and i
in a pulic house
were playing dominos one night
into the room the barman came
his face a ghastly white
what's up says brown
have you seen a ghost
have you seen your aunt myriah
""oh my aunt myriah be buggered!"" says he
""the bloody pub's on fire!""
""on fire !"" says brown
""what a bit of luck.
everybody follow me.
into the cellar if the fire's not there
we'll have a rare old spree!""
so we all went down after good old brown
the booze we could not miss
and we were'nt there 5 minutes or more
when we were all half pissed
and there was brown, upside down
lappin' up the whiskey on the floor
booze booze the firemen cried
as they came knockin' at the door
don't let them in till it's all mopped up
somebody shouted ""macintyre""
and we all got blue blind
paralytic drunk
when the old dun cow caught fire
then smith went over
to the port wine tub
gave it a few hard knocks
started taken' off his pantaloons
likewise his shoes and socks
""hold on!"" says brown
""you can't do that!
we can't have that in here!
don't go washin' your trotters
in the port wine tub
when we've got all this lite beer""
and then there came an awful crash
half the roof gave way
we were drowned in the fireman's hose
but still we were going to stay
so we got some tacks
and our old wet slacks
and nailed ourselves inside
and we sat there swallyin'
pints of stout
till we were bleary eyed!"
Old Dungarvin Oak,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=274,"as i roved out one mornin'
goin' to dungarvin fair
i spied a pretty colleen
with the sunlight in her hair
her way was so delightful
her voice rang like a bell
and as i overtook her
i asked if she was well
lay down your wollen shawl my love
i swear it is not joke
and i'll tell to you the story of
the old dungarvin oak
before we reached dungarvin
the girl and i did stare
and she asked me why i raised my hat
to a tree so old and bare
i told her of the legend
if the tree should e're come down
there'd be a great disaster
and dungarvin would be drowned  
well then she started laughin'
my face grew very red
she said theat only fools believed
what those old legends said
her laughter was contagious
for the truth to you i'll tell
before we reached the marketplace
i began to laugh as well  
as i'm sittin' by my fireside
in the autumn of my life
the darlin' girl i met that day
she's now my darlin' wife
i have a lovely daughter
and a son to push my yoke
and it's all because i raised my hat
to the old dungarvin oak  "
Old Ireland Free Once More,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=426,"a.k.a gra mo chroide (eire og)
last night i had a happy dream,
though restless where i be i dreamt again,
brave irishmen had set old ireland free
and how excited i became when i heard the cannons roar
oh gra mo chree, i long to see old ireland free once more.
it`s true we`ve had brave irishmen as everyone must know
o`neil, o`donnell, sarsfield too lord edward and wolfe tone
also robert emmett who till death did not give o`er
gra mo chree, i long to see old ireland free once more.
now we can't forget the former years they're kept in memory still
of the wexford men of '98 who fought on vinegar hill
with father murphy at their side and the green flag waving o'er
oh gra mo chree, i long to see old ireland free once more.
allan, o`brien and larkin died their country to set free
someday soon brave irish men will make the english flee
by day and night they`ll always fight `til death they`ll not give o`er
gra mo chree, i long to see old ireland free once more."
Old Maid in a Garrett,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=275,"i have often heard it said from me father and me mother
that the going to a weddin' is the making of another
well, if this be true, i will go without a biddin'
o kind providence, won't you send me to a wedding
and its o dear me, how would it be,
if i die an old maid in a garret
well, there's my sister jean, she's not handsome or good looking
barely sixteen and she had a fella courtin'
now she's twenty-four with a son and a daughter
here am i at forty-five and i've never had an offer
i can cook and i can sew and i can keep the house right tidy
rise up in the morning and get the breakfast ready
there's nothing in this wide world would make me half so cheery
as a wee fat manny who would call me his own deary
so come landsman or come kinsman, come tinker or come tailor
come fiddler or come dancer, come ploughboy or come sailor
come rich man, come poor man, come fool or come witty
come any man at all that will marry me for pity
well now i'm away home 'cause there's nobody heeding
there's nobody heedin' to poor old annie's pleadin'
i'll go away to my own wee bit garret
if i can't get a man, then i'll surely get a parrot"
Old Orange Flute,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=276,"tune:sweet betsy from pike
in the county tyrone, in the town of dungannon
where many a ruction myself had a hand in
bob williamson he lived, a weaver by trade
and all of us thought him the stout orange blade.
on the twelfth of july as it yearly did come
bob played on the flute to the sound of the drum
you can talk of your lyre, your piano or lute
but there's none could compare to the old orange flute.
but bob that deceiver he took us all in
for he married a papish named bridget mcginn
turned papish himself and forsook the old cause
that gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
and the boys in the place made some comment upon  it
and bob had to fly to the province of connaught;
he left with his wife and his fixins, to boot,
and along with the latter, the old orange flute.
at mass the next sunday, to atone for past deeds,
said paters and aves and counted his beads
till after some time at the priest's own desire
bob went with his flute for to play in the choir.
bob went with his flute for to play in the mass
but the instrument shivered and cried.""o alas!""
and try though he would, though he made a great noise,
the flute would play only ""the protestant boys"".
well up bob he jumped with a start and a flutter.
he threw the old flute in the blessed holy water;
he thought that this charm would bring some other sound,
when he tried it again, it played ""croppies lie down!""
now for all he would finger and whistle and blow
for to play papish music, he found it ""no go""
""kick the pope"" to ""boyne water""  it clearly would sound
but one papish squeek and it could'nt be found.
at a council of priests that was held the next day
they decided to banish the old flute away;
they couldn't knock heresy out of its head
so they bought bob a new one to play it instead.
now the poor was doomed, and its fate was pathetic
'twas fastened and burnt at the stake as heretic.
as the flames soared around , you could hear a strange noise
'twas the old flute still a-whistlin' ""the protestant boys""."
Old Refrain (The),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=463,"the old refrain
i often think of home dee-ol-ee-ay
when i am all alone and far away;
i sing an old refrain, dee-ol-ee-ay
for it recalls to me a bygone day
it takes me back again to meadows fair
where sunlight's golden rays beam everywhere
my childhood joys again come back to me
my mother's face in fancy too i see
it was my mother taught me how to sing
and to that memory my heart will cling
i'm never sad and alone while on my way
as long as i can sing dee-ol-ee-ay
though years have passed and gone, dee-ol-ee-ay
and though my heart is young my head is grey.
yet still the echoes ring, dee-ol-ee-ay
and dear old memories forever stay.
this song will bring me visions full of light
and sweetest dreams throughout the darkest night
of all that life can give, that song is best
i'll take it with me when i go to rest
and when at last my journey here is o'er
'twill ring more joyfully than e'er before
for up to heavens i will take my lay
the angels, too, will sing dee-ol-ee-ay
from the 1936 musical the king steps out"

Once Upon a Dream O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=278,"once upon a dream
i looked out among the stars
and watched a scene
of angels playing their guitars
it's you for me
and anyone who needs to know
there is a heaven
a better place not far away
and i wonder, as i wander
if you hear my prayers for you
and with each passing day
i hope you know that i still love you
once upon this life
you ran away, a passing glance
my toil, my strife
is eased a bit to know you dance
it's you for me
and anyone who needs to know
there is a heaven
a gift for you that has been given
and i wonder, as i wander
even though you live above
with each passing day
i hope you know i feel your love
once upon this night
i'll light a candle, though it's far
to pass through the night
to meet the light that is your star
and you and i
can meet again among the clouds
until we meet in heaven
a dwelling place eternally
and i wonder, as i wander
if your purpose in this life
was to light my way
to guarantee we'll meet in heaven
...guarantee we'll meet in heaven
this song was written for my friends marilyn and joe who lost their daughter jodi. they became involved in ""compassionate friends,"".each year on the 2nd sunday in december, candles are lighted in every time zone around the world for a ""theorhetical"" wave of light in rememberance of children who have passed over. marilyn asked me to write a song for the occasion. when we recorded the song in nashville, two of the musicians also were members of compassionate friends. this song is to somehow give whatever miniscule level of comfort i could give for grieving parents."
One Beer Education,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=576,"a young 20 something walked into a bar
with dreams of fame and fortune
he carried his guitar
he said, ""i need a place to start my pathway to the stars""
while an old man sat and listened
with his music battle scars
the owner sat and smiled and asked,
""son, have you been to school?
you'll need an education so you don't play the fool.
you see that old man sittin'? you should buy that man a beer
and he'll give you some wisdom
you just might need to hear.""
the kid said , ""i might as well. this won't take very long.
i might even be inspired to write my latest song.""
he brought the man a pint and said
""i hear you're pretty smart and you'll give me directions
to fame and fortune and the stars.""
""he said i spent a lifetime making music on the road.
but miles of aches and pains have made my life a heavy load
but i'll give you the secret how to ease the work and strife
there's only just one way to make great music in your life""
you've got to do what you love
love what you do
make a living from your passion
and your living will be true
forget about the stardom, big mansions and fast cars
true success and happiness is only in your heart
"" i drove in every blizzard from new england to the lakes
missed my children's concerts
and for that my heart still aches
stressed out each relationship
windshields make me bored
and hours of preparation before i even strummed a chord
but i think about the friends i've made as i traveled this great land
made me richer than most kings and almost any man
the talent i was given, well i guess it made me able
to put my kids through college
and food upon their table
""now you might have the talent, ambition and the drive
but if you're going to take this path son
take a deep look what's inside
the toll this job will cost your family and your health
well, you better reconsider son
what you consider wealth
now i have been successful
but not what you consider fame
and the truth be told few people know my name.....""
the information fell upon him like a revelation
it's amazing what you'll learn
from a one beer education"
One Eyed Reilly,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=279,"giddy eye ay, giddy eye ay,
giddy eye ay for the one eyed reilly

eatin spuds and a drinkin' porter
suddenly a thought came into my head
i'd like to marry old reilly's daughter  
old reilly played on a big bass drum
reilly had a mind for murder and slaughter
reilly had a big red glistenin' eye
and he kept that eye on his lovely daughter  
her hair was black and her eyes were blue
the major and the corporal and the captain saught her
the sergeant and the piper and the drummer boy too
they never had a chance with reilly's daughter

i got me a scratch in a merry quarter
settled me down to a peaceful life
happy as a king with reilly's daughter  
well five big knocks come knockin' at the door
who should it be but reilly after slaughter
with two pistols in his hand
lookin' for the man what had married his daughter  
i grabbed old reilly by the hair
i rammed his head in a pail of water
shot his pistols into the air
a damn sight quicker than i married his daughter  "
One for the Morning Glory,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=280,"at the end of the day i like a little drink to raise my voice and sing
and another or two of a pint of brew and i'm ready for anything

and every night when they'd turn out the light i'd tip toe up the stairs singin'
one for the morning glory
two for the early dew
three for the man who whould stand his round
and four for the love of you my girl
four for the love of you
well i got the call from foreign shores to go and fight the foe
though i thought no more of the sisters four, still i was sad to go
we sailed away on a ship, the morning glory was her name
and we'd all fall down when the rum went 'round and we'd get up and start again 
well we sailed once more to our native shore farewell to the native sea

but there on the shore were the sisters four with a bundle on each knee
there were three little girls and a bouncin' boy and they all looked just like me  "

Only Our Rivers Run Free,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=283,"when apples still grow in november,
when blossoms still grow from each tree,
when leaves are still green in december,
it's then that our land will be free.
i've wandered her hills and her valleys,
and still through my sorrow i see,
a land that has never known freedom,
and only our rivers run free.
i drink to the death of her manhood
those men who'd rather have died
than to live in the cold chains of bondage
to bring back their rights were denied.
oh, where are you now that we need you,
what burns where the flame used to be
are you gone like the snow of last winter
and only our rivers run free
how sweet is life, but we're crying
how mellow the wine, but we're dry.
how fragrant the rose, but it's dying
how gentle the wind, but it sighs.
what good is in youth when it's aging?
what good is in eyes that can't see?
whem there's sorrow in sunshine and flowers
and only our rivers run free."
Orange and the Green,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=282,"once there was an irishman, a protestant was he
my mother was a catholic, from kelsey town came she
they were married in two churches,lived happily enough
until the day that i was born then things got rather tough
oh, it was the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
my father he was orange and my mother she was green
baptized by father reilly, and rushed away by car
to become a little orangeman, my father's shining star
i was christened david anthony but still in spite of that
to my father i was billy while my mother called me pat
now, with mother every sunday to mass we'd proudly stroll
and later on the orange lodge would try to save my soul
both sides they tried to claim me but i was bad because
i'd play me flute or play me harp depending where i was
now, when i'd sing those rebel songs 'twould fill my mother's joy
my father would jump up and say """"now look here bill me boy
that's enough of that stuff!"", he'd be tossin' me a coin
to sing about the orange flute and the heroes of the boyne
well, one day my father's kinfolk, they came to visit me
too bad my mother's relatives were sittin' down to tea
i tried to calm things over as they began to fight
but bein' strictly neutral i punched everyone in sight
well, my parents they would not agree about my kind of school
the learnin' was all done at home and that's why i'm a fool
now they've both passed on god bless them but they left me caught between
that awful color problem of the orange and the green"
Ordinary Man,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=284,"i'm an ordinary man, nothin' special nothin' grand
i had to work for everything i own
i never asked for a lot i was happy with what i got
enought to keep my family and my home
now they say that times are hard and they've handed me my card
they say there's not the work to go around
and when the whistle blows, the gates will finally close
tonight they're going to shut this factory down
*and they'll tear it down
well i never missed a day, nor went on strike for better pay
for twenty years i gave them the best i could
with a handshake and a check it's so easy to forget
the loyalty through the bad times and the good
now the owner says he's sad to see that things have got so bad
but the captain's of industry won't let him loose
but still he drives a car, and smokes his big cigars
still he takes his family on a cruise
*he'll never lose
now it seems to be such a cruel irony, he's richer now than he ever was before
now my check is spent and i can't afford the rent
there's one law for the rich, one for the poor
and everyday i try to salvage, so of my pride
to find some work so i might pay my way
but everywhere i go, the answer's always ,""no""
there's no work for anyone here today
*no work today
here condemned i stand just an ordinary man, like thousands before me in the queue
i watch my darlin' wife, tryin' to make the best of life
god knows what the kids are goin' to do
now that we are faced, with this human waste
a generation cast aside
as long as i live, i never will forgive
they've stripped me of my dignity and pride
*they've stripped  me bare, they've stripped me bare"

when i found myself outside a cabin door
well i just stepped in to light my pipe as any lad might do
when going to or coming from a fair
when i spied a lovely colleen with two eyes a meltin' blue
it was really then me heart felt very queer
i love to ramble down the ould booreen
when the hawthrorn blossoms are in bloom
and to sit by the gate on an ould muddy seat
a whisperin' to kate muldoon
i was comin' from me barn from a neighborin' boreen
when i met sweet kitty trippin' like a fawn
and she gave me such a smile that i felt like in a dream
and i never slept a wink that night till dawn
but the next time that i saw her sure i told her of me love
she blushed and almost let her basket fall
she said, ""go on you schemer!"" with a gentle little shove
and whispered, ""ask me father!"" that was all  
i was thrashin' in me barn when her father came one day
he said,""patsy hogan what is this i've heard?
i've been speakin' to me daughter and now what have you to say?""
but sure faith i couldn't say a single word
then he took me by the hand and said, ""now patrick my son
i'll be glad to see you settled well in life.
and since you love me daughter and her heart is fairly won
at shrove tide you can make the girl your wife.""   "
Ould Triangle (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=286,"oh a hungry feelin' came over me stealin'

the seagulls wheeling high above the wall

Paddy Lay Back,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=443,"'twas a cold and dreary morning in december december
all of me money, it was spent, spent, spent
where it went to, lord, i can't remember remember
so down to the shipping office i went went, went!
paddy lay back, paddy lay back!
take in the slack, take in the slack
take a turn around the capstan, heave a pawl! heave a pawl
about ship's stations, boys, be handy be handy!
we're bound for valipariso 'round the horn!
that day there was a great demand for sailors,
for the colonies, for 'frisco and for france.
so i shipped aboard a limey barque, the hotspur,
an' got paralytic drunk on my advance.
now i joined her on a cold december mornin',
a-frappin' o' me flippers to keep me warm,
with the south cone a-hoisted as a warnin',
to stand by the comin' of a storm.
now some of our fellers had been drinkin',
an' i meself was heavy on the booze.
an' i was on me ol' sea-chest a' thinking'
i'd turn into me bunk an' have a snooze.
i woke up in the mornin' sick an' sore,
i knew i was outward bound again;
i hears a voice a-bawlin' at the door, `
`lay aft, ye sods, an' answer to yer names.''
'twas on the quarterdeck where i first saw 'em.
such an ugly bunch i never seen before,
for there was a bum and stiff from every quarter,
(for the captain had shipped a shanghai crew of dutchmen)
an' it made me poor ol' heart feel sick and sore.
there was spaniards an' dutchmen an' rooshians,
an' johnny crapoos jist acrost from france.
an' most of them could speak no word of english,
but answered to the name of `month's advance!'
i wisht i was in the ``jolly sailor,''
along with irish kate a-drinkin' beer,
an' then i thought what jolly chaps were sailors,
an' with me flipper i wiped away a tear.
i knew that in me box i had a bottle,
by the boardin'-master 'twas put there;
an' i wanted something for to wet me throttle,
somethin' for to drive away dull care.
so down upon me knees i went like thunder,
put me hand into the bottom o' the box,
an' what wuz me great surprise an' wonder,
found only a bottle o' medicine for the pox.
i felt that i should skip an' join another,
'twas plain that i had joined a lousy bitch;
but the chances wuz that i might join a worser,
an' we might git through the voyage without a hitch.
i axed the mate a-which a-watch was mine-o,
says he, ``i'll soon pick out a-which is which,''
an' he blowed me down an' kicked me hard a stern-o,
callin' me a lousy, dirty son o' a bitch.
now we singled up an' got the tugs alongside,
they towed us through the locks an' out to sea;
with half the crew a-pukin' o'er the ship's side,
an' the bloody fun that started sickened me.
although me poor ol' head wuz all a-jumpin',
we had to loose her rags the followin' morn;
i dream the boardin'-master i was thumpin',
when i found out he'd sent me around the horn.
i swore i would become a beachie-comber,
an' niver go to sea no ruddy more;
for niver did i want to be a roamer,
i'd shanghai the boardin'-master an' stay ashore.
but when we got to bully ol' vallaparaiser,
in the bay we dropped our mudhook far from shore;
the ol' man he refused ter let us raise 'er,
an' he stopped the boardin'-masters comin' aboard.
i quickly made me mind up that i'd jump 'er,
i'd leave the beggar an' git a job ashore;
i swum across the bay an' went an' left 'er,
an' in the english bar i found a whore.
but jimmy the wop (crimp) he knew a thing or two, sir,
an' soon he'd shipped me outward bound again;
on a limey to the chinchas for guanner,
an' soon wuz i a-roarin' this refrain.
so there was i once more again at sea, boys,
the same ol' ruddy business o'er again.
oh, stamp the caps'n round an' make some noise, boys,
an' sing again this dear ol' sweet refrain.
recorded by warner and davis br thanks to mudcat for the digital tradition!"
Paddy McGinty's Goat,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=287,"mr. patrick mcginty, an irishman of note,
came into a fortune, so bought himself a goat.
said he, ""sure, of goat's milk i mean to have my fill!""
but when he got his nanny home, he found it was a bill.
and now all the ladies who live in killaloo
are all wearing bustles like their mothers used to do.
they each wear a bolster beneath the petticoat,
and leave the rest to providence and paddy mcginty's goat!
missis burke to her daughter said, ""listen, mary jane, .
now who was the man you were cuddling in the lane?
he'd long wiry whiskers all hanging from his chin.""
""twas only pat mcginty's goat, "" she answer'd with a grin.
then she went away from the village in disgrace,
she came back with powder and paint upon her face.
she'd rings on her fingers, and she wore a sable coat,
you bet your life they never came from paddy mcginty's goat.
little norah mccarthy the knot was going to tie,
she washed all her trousseau and hung it out to dry.
then up came the goat and he saw the bits of white:
he chewed up all her falderals, and on her wedding night:
""oh turn out the gas quick!"" she shouted out to pat,
for though l'm your bride, sure l'm not worth looking at.
i'd got two of ev'rything, i told you when i wrote,
but now i've one of nothing, all thro' paddy mcginty's goat.'
mickey riley he went to the races t'other day.
he won twenty dollars and shouted, ""hip hooray!!""
he held up the note, shouting ""look what i've got!""
the goat came up and grabbed at it and swallowed all the lot.
""he's eaten my banknote,"" said mickey, with the hump.
they ran for the doctor, he brought a stomach pump.
he pumped and he pumped for that twenty dollar note,
but all he got was ninepence out of paddy mcginty's goat."
Paddy Works on the Railway,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=451,"in eighteen hundred and forty one
i put my corduroy breeches on
i put my corduroy breeches on
to work upon the railway...
in eighteen hundred and forty two
i left the old world for the new
bad cess to the luck that brought me through
to work upon the railway...
in eighteen hundred and forty three
'twas then i met sweet biddy mcgee
an elegant wife she's been to me
while working on the railway... i
t's 'pat, do this,' and 'pat, do that'
without a stocking or a cravat
and nothing but an old straw hat,
while working on the railway...
in eighteen hundred and forty six
they pelted me with stones and sticks
oh, i was in a terrible fix,
while working on the railway...
in eighteen hundred and forty seven
sweet biddy mcgee she went to heaven
if she left one child, she left eleven,
to work upon the railway...
in eighteen hundred forty eight,
i learned to take me whiskey straight
'tis an elegant drink and can't be bate,
for working on the railway...

Paddys Green Shamrock Shore,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=288,"oh fare-thee-well, sweet liza dear, and my own derry town
it breaks my heart to see friends part, for it's then that the teardrops fall;
i'm on my way to amerikay, will i e'er see my home once more?
for now i leave my own true love on paddy's green shamrock shore.
our ship she lies at anchor, she's standing by the quay
may fortune bright shine down each night, as we sail over the sea
many ships were lost, many lives it cost on the journey that lies before
with a tear in my eye i'm bidding good-bye to paddy's green shamrock shore.
so fare thee well my own true love, i'll think of you night and day
and a place in my mind you surely will find, although i am so far away
though i'll be alone far away from my home, i'll think of the good times once more,
until the day i can make my way back to paddy's green shamrock shore.
and now the ship is on the waves may heaven protect us all
with the wind in the sail we surely can't fail on this voyage to baltimore
but my parents and friends did wait till the end, till i could see them no more
i then took a chance for to glance at paddy's green shamrock shore."
Paddys Unicorn O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=410,"to the tune of 'the unicorn'
 there were green marqueritas a
nd long neck brews pina coladas,
slow comfortable screws
a slippery nipple's what i'm talking about
but my favorite of all is the guinness stout
long time ago when the bars were dry
the lack of libation could make a grown man cry
you'd go without a beverage
it you didn't know the knock
unless you had a tub with your home made stock
paddy's glass was empty which caused him pain
he set out to find a drink but he searched in vain
his body started shakin' he couldn't get no rest
so he tried to keep the high by smellin' his own breath
c
paddy looked out through the drivin' rain he said, '
this way of life is makin' me insane.'
he said, 'give me a sign lord, don't leave me in the lurch.'
and he found himself standing outside a church
c
paddy started movin' he drifted inside
what he found was religion and he wept and cried
he thought he went to heaven he thought he had died
when he was greeted at the altar with a glass of wine.
c then prohibition ended, the law ended in the ditch
nascar had its roots and joe kennedy was rich
paddy said, 'i thank you lord you helped me see the light.
i'm back to drinkin' guinness almost every night.'"
Parting Glass,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=289,"oh of all the money that e're i spent
i spent it in good company
and of all the harm that e're ive done
alas it was to none but me
for all i've done for want of wit
to mem'ry now i can't recall
so fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all
oh if i had money enough to spend
and leisure time to sit awhile
there is a fair maid in this town
and she surely has my heart beguiled
her rosey cheeks, her ruby lips
i own she has my heart enthralled
so fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all
oh of all the comrades that e're i've had
they are sorry for my going away
and of all the sweethearts that e're i've had
they would wish me one more day to stay
but since it falls unto my lot
that i should rise and you should not
i'll gently rise and softly call
good night and joy be with you all"
Pat Malone Forgot He Was Dead,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=514,"times were hard in irish town;
everything was going down,
pat malone was pushed for ready cash.
he'd the life insurance spent;
all his money, too, had went
and all of his affairs had gone to smash.
his wife spoke up and said,
'now, dear pat, if you were dead
this twenty thousand dollars we could take.'
and so pat laid down and tried
to make out that he had died
until he smelled the whiskey at the wake.
then pat malone forgot that he was dead.
he raised himself in the bed and what he said,
'if this wake goes on a minute, to be sure the corpse is in it
you'll have to keep me drunk to keep me dead'
so they gave the corpse a cup
and afterward they filled it up
and laid him down again upon the bed.
and before the morning grey everybody felt so gay
they forgot that pat was only playing dead.
so they loaded him from the bunk
still alive but awful drunk
and put him in the coffin with a prayer.
and the driver of the cart said,
'be god, i'll never start
until i see that someone pays the fare.'
then pat malone forgot that he was dead.
he raised himself in the coffin, while he said,
'if you fairly doubt my credit
you'll be sorry that you said it
you drive on or else the corpse will break your head.
so the funeral started out
on the cemetery route,
and the neighbors tried the widow to console.
'til they got beside the base
of malone's last resting place
and gently lowered patrick in the hole.
then pat began to see just as plain as one could see
that he'd forgot to reckon on the end.
and as clods began to drop
he broke loose the coffin top
and quickly to the earth he did ascend.
then pat malone forgot that he was dead,
and from the cemetery quickly fled.
he came nearly going under
it's a lucky thing, by thunder,
that pat malone forgot that he was dead.*"
Patrick Sheehan,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=290,"my name is patrick sheehan and my years of 34
tiperarry is my dwelling place not far from gownty moore
i come from honest parents who now are laying low
and many a pleasant day i spent in the glen of averlow
my father died i closed his eyes outside our cabin door
the landlord and sheriff they were there the day before
and then my loving mother and my sisters they all sore
were forced the go with broken hearts from the glen  of averlow
for three long months in search of work i wandered far and near
i went into the workhouse for the see my mother dear
the news i heard near broke my heard but still in all my woe
i bless the friends that made her grave
and now young men who long to roam take heed of what i say
don't ever join the soldier's ranks or wander far away

remember patrick sheehan and the land of averlow"
Patrick Was a Gentleman,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=291,"saint patrick was a gentleman, came from decent people
built the church in dublin town, and on it put a steeple
his father was a gallagher, his mother was a brady
his aunt was an o'shaughnessy, his uncle was a grady
the wicklow hills are very high, and so's the hill of howth, sir
but there's a hill much higher still, much higher than them both, sir
on the top of this high hill st. patrick preached his sermom
which drove the frogs into the bogs and banished all the vermin
there's not a mile of eirann's isle where dirty vermin musters
but there he put his dear fore-foot and murdered them in clusters
the frogs went hop and the toads went pop slapdash into the water
and the snakes committed suicide to save themselves from slaughter
nine hundred thousand reptiles blue he charmed with sweet discourses
and dined on them in killaloe on soups and second courses
where blind worms crawling in the grass disgusted all the nation
right down to hell with a holy spell he changed their situation
no wonder that them irish lads should be so gay and frisky
sure st. pat he taught them that as well as making whiskey
no wonder that the saint himself should understand distilling
for his mother kept a shebeen shop in the town of enniskillen
was i but so fortunate as to be back in munster
i'd be bound that from that ground i never more would once stir
there st. patrick planted turf and cabbages and praties
pigs galore, mo gra/, mo sto/r, altar boys and ladies.

Patriot Game,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=292,"come all ye young rebels, and list while i sing,
for the love of one's country is a terrible thing.
it banishes fear with the speed of a flame,
and it makes us all part of the patriot game.
my name is o'hanlon, and i've just turned sixteen.
my home is in monaghan, and where i was weaned
i learned all my life cruel england's to blame,
so now i am part of the patriot game.
this ireland of ours has too long been half free.
six counties lie under john bull's tyranny.
i've thrown out my bible to drill and to train
to take up my part in the patriot game.
it's nearly two years since i went away
with the local battalion of the bold ira,
for i read of our heroes, and wanted the same
to play out my part in the patriot game.
and now as i lie here, my body all holes
i think of those traitors who bargained in souls
and i wish that my rifle had given the same
to those quislings who sold out the patriot game.

a troubled mind can find no rest

it was my fancy, i do declare
for when i'm drinking, i'm always thinking
wishing peggy gordon was there
i wished i was in a lonesome valley
where womankind cannot be found
and the pretty little birds do change their voices
and every moment a different sound

far away across the briny sea
sailing over deepest waters
where love nor care never trouble me"

Perfect Man (The)   O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=296,"i want a man with a job
a real stand up guy
a sensitive guy
who's not afraid to cry
when he closes his eyes
he doesn't think of some blond
and doesn't think 2 minutes
is a marathon
of his physical abilities
let this be said
make him 3 feet tall
with a breathing hole
right smack dab in the middle of the back of his head!
when it comes to talking sexy
this is what he'll say
""honey you go out.
i'll watch the kids today.
i'll watch you try on outfits
no that's not lame
i'll even turn off the tv
it's only a game""
""let's go visit the in-laws
i gave them a call.
we'll get some advice
and than go to the mall
""we'll spend the afternoon shopping,
you need some more shoes
there's a sale at the outlet
there's no time to lose.""
and he'll say,
""take your time
getting ready
honey now you look great
you know i don't mind
that we're running 2 hours late.""
and some skill in the bedroom
now that's a must
a marathon winner
of the pelvic thrust
a man who likes to be
on top of his game
and his hand won't cramp
when we're into foreplay
he only thinks of me
when he closes his eyes
and he always thinks my breasts
are the perfect size
a guy who'll keep working
until i'm finished
can't you find me a man
who lasts more than 2 minutes?
and he'll say,
""i've got comfortable shoes on
and i can't wait to dance
honey there ain't no way
that you look fat in those pants
how 'bout a conversation
with some intellect
don't forget i have a brain
show some respect!
give a call from the job
just to say ""hello""
that's money to prove
you're not the average joe.
he puts me on a pedestal
he thinks i'm the best
he doesn't put me there
just to look up my dress
he can pick me up quick
when i'm feeling poor
with a wine and a woody
waiting at the door
and he'll say,
""honey you work the clicker
when we watch the tv.
you do it so much better
you even drive better than me!""
and he'll say,
""honey, i think i'm lost now
my brain must have taken a nap
i think i'll ask for directions
or even look at a map!"""

all the times he held me steady through this cold and rocky land
i would hold his hand so tightly as he would guide me on my way
it's these memories, will never fade away
i remember your september leaves, soon began to change
it was then that you secured the help of this old wooden cane
and the snow so ever softly, began to fall into your hair
as you began your walk through autumn's air
you have spent your lifetime protecting me from harm
when your steady hand was placed into my own
and times when we're apart, as simple as it seems
it's your memory that guides me phillip greene
as november days grew ever short and winter called your name
you traded in your earthly trails for ones to come your way
and our springtime walks through memories became the ties that bind
as i watched you slip away while by your side
now as my september leaves fall softly to the ground
your guiding hand still leads me with this memory i've found
when i hold the steady handle of the cane that was phil greene's,
it's your hand and not a handle that i hold when e're i dream
you will spend my lifetime protecting me from harm
when your steady cane is placed into my hand
and times when we're apart, as simple as it seems
it's your memory that guides me phillip greene

Pickle Bill,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=299,"one cold winter on the grand river
on the south coast of lake erie
came an ice flo pushin', down the river it was rushin'
to get on out to sea
well the waves were slashin' and the water it was crashin'
as rough as rough could be
till the crest made a charge at the pickle bill's barge
broke the lines and set it free
(yessir, the barge was at large)
well the barge took a ride on the highest of tides
it passed the salt plant on the way
and it sure wasn't timid when it broke the speed limit
of fifteen knots in the bay
there was no deterrent as it rode on the current
in the wind and in the snow
""since i'm on the water, i'll go get an order
of wings in buffalo!""
(it was the ultimate ""takeout"" restaurant)
well it floated away past beaches and bays
without a map and nary a chart
until it strayed 100 miles away
to erie not new york
but the powells they found it and decided to round up
a vessel salvage crew
but when the crew they found it, they proceded to drowned it
and it sunk in the great big blue
now the effort was rotten and as it sunk to the bottom
the barge had a revelation
it said, ""today is my lucky day!
this is a great retaurant location!
i've got a fresh supply of fresh walleye
fresh lake trout and fresh perch.
with all these sea creatures and jerry as my teacher
i can make this business work!""
""we'll need some extra hands."" so he hired some clams
and a sponge to do the dishes
a large mouth bass would collect the cash
'cause the food would be delicious
an electric eel made the fuse box reel
for lights and juice for the fryer
when the menu was set you could surely get
any seafood you desire
next it was reported some penguins were imported
they served the classiest dish of cod
a mermaid contingent for topless entertainment
if you just wanted to get scrod!
it was the ultimate wet bar, raw bar, sand bar
you'd ever seen in your day
why the place was so cool, there were schools on stools
eatin' buckets of bouillabaisse
all things ended when a diver decended
with a lifeline and a cable
while he waited for the tug to pull the line snug
he sat down at the table
well, he had a fine feast with the deep sea beasts
when the waiter said, ""i hope you don't mind.
there's nary a bigot on this deep sea frigate,
but i've never served the likes of your kind!""
then without warnin' the very same mornin'
the cable began to quiver
the barge was raised back to the wind and the waves
and towed back to grand river.
marianne and jerry watched while the ferry
sailed on past ohio's hills
now the barge is parked and permanetly locked
and docked at pickle bill's
now the moral of the story of this tale of glory
whenever you go out to eat
no one knows more about the food on shore
than the one who's visited the sea

Pizza Boy O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=449,": oh the pizza boy is coming, the pizza boy is here i've got your fresh hot pizza, i've got your treat right here when i was only 16 years i thought i'd get a job so i went into the pizza shop he said, 'do you drive a car?' i said, 'i got a license as fresh as it could be.' he said, 'congratulations! you're in delivery.' from my very 1st assignment i tried to be the best to be the person at your door with somthing hot and fresh the boss he pulled me to the side and said, 'for what this pays. you're doing such a fine job, i've arranged for you a raise.'  now i was real excited at what the boss did say. i worked extra hard thru friday, and that was my payday the boss said, 'special delivery at the far end of the line. be looking for the red light at house #69.' now i was really nervous, i didn't know what to do. i had a funny feeling it's a house o' ill repute i wondered what the boss he meant when he said, 'you may be long.' so i stood under the red light and sang my pizza song.'  a lady opened up the door,said 'we've been expecting you.' she was wearin' sort of a nighty that i could see right thru i began a sweatin' and i turned hard like a stone when she said, 'hey where's your sausage? how big's your pepperone?' now i was frozen solid and didn't know what to say. so i said, 'hey here's ya pizza all i need now is my pay.' she said, 'i'll take your pizza but today's your lucky day. the change'll be in your pocket, 'cause i'm paying you in trade!'  i said, 'i'm not complainin'. not even a little bit. i'm the one who gave her da pizza, i'm the one who gave her da tip.' a compliment she gave to me, 'you're the fastest in the land. the day when this pizza boy...became a pizza man! now i own the pizza shop the kids all work for me. still there is occasion for a special delivery and when i see the order ticket hangin' from the shelf that's when i'll tell the pizza boy...hey!..i'll be taken this one myself!  i need to give credit to 'big john' at shenanigan's in ocean city (where i'll be performing next summer). he sang the original version of this which i'm told was written by a guy in connecticut. i only heard the song once but i was so taken with the concept i wrote my own lyrics to his idea. thanks big john."
Pub with no Beer,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=300,"it's lonesome away
from your kindred and all
by the camp fire at night
where the wild dingoes call,
but there's nothing so lonesome
so morbid or drear
than to stand at the bar
of a pub with no beer.
now the publican's anxious
for the quota to come
there's a far away look
on the face of the bum
the maid's gone all cranky
and the cook's acting queer
what a terrible place
is a pub with no beer.
then the stock-man rides up
with his dry dusty throat
he breasts up to the bar,
pulls a wat from his coat,
but the smile on his face
quickly turns to a sneer,
when the bar man said sadly
the pub's got no beer.
there's a dog on the veranda
for his master he waits
but the boss is inside
drinking wine with his mates
he hurries for cover
and cringes in fear
it's no place for a dog
round a pub with no beer.
old billy the blacksmith
first time in his life
has gone home cold sober
to his darling wife,
he walks in the kitchen,
she says you're early me dear,
but he breaks down and tells her
the pub's got no beer
since peter crawford has been telling us stories from the bush (see p. 4), this seems an appropriate item  not least, for its historical significance. most people know the famous song by slim dusty but this is the original poem it was based on. daniel sheahan (18821977) was an irish-born farmer in north queensland who rode 30 km to the day dawn hotel in ingham, only to find that a convoy of american servicemen from the 22nd bomb group, travelling north from townsville, had consumed all the beer the night before. (hence, the many references to wartime rationing in the fourth verse.)
the poem was published in the north queensland register in 1944 and it must have circulated widely, as it was discovered by the songwriter, gordon parsons, at a pub in macksville, new south wales, in 1956. he re- wrote the verses and put them to music before offering it to slim dusty, who recorded it in 1957. the song became australias first worldwide hit and it has since been translated into seven languages.
the day dawn hotel was partly rebuilt in 1960 and renamed the lees hotel. in 1988, it was officially recog- nised by the bicentennial commemoration and a bronze plaque was awarded proclaiming it the original pub with no beer. the lees is also the only pub on the heritage list of the queensland national trust.
readers can learn much more about these matters from: www.thepubwithnobeer.com.au, which also has an impressive photo gallery. sheahan wrote many other poems, a collection of which, titled songs from the cane- fields, was published in 1980. two of his other works were converted to songs by slim dusty but it has proven impossible to find out what they were.

Quare Bungle Rye,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=448,"jack was a sailor who roamed downed the town
he met with a damsel who skipped up and down
says the damsel to jack, as she passed him by
'would you care for to purchase
some quare bungle rye.' rad-dee-rye,
: fol-da-diddle-rye rad-dee-rye, rad-dee-rye
now says jack to himself, 'now what can this be,
but the finest of whiskey from far germany.'
'smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
and the name that it goes by is quare bungle rye.'
jack gave her a pound and he thought nothing strange
says she, 'hold now me basket, while i run for your change.'
he took a look in the basket, a child he did spy
'ah, be damn it,' says jack, 'this is quare bungle rye.'
to get the child christened was jack's next intent
to get the child christened to the parson he went
says the parson to jack, 'now, what will he go by?'
'ah, be damn it,' says jack, 'call him quare bungle rye.'
says the parson to jack, 'that's a very quare name.'
'ah, be damn it,' says jack, ''tis a quare way he came.'
'smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
and the name that he'll go by is quare bungle rye.'
come all you young sailors that roam down the town
beware of those damsels that skip up and down
beware of those damsels as they pass you by
or else they might pawn on you quare bungle rye,"
Queen of Argyle,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=515,"gentlemen it is my duty
to inform you of one beauty,
tho i ask from you a favor not to seek for a while.
tho i own to here's a creature
of character and feature
for no one could paint the picture
of the queen of argyle.
and if you could have seen her there,
boys if you had just been there,
the swan was in her movement
and the morning in her smile.
oh, the roses in the garden
they bowed and asked for pardon
for not one could match the beauty
of the queen of argyle.
on the evening that i've mentioned
i passed with light intention
thru a part of our dear country
known for beauty and for style.
in a place known for dangers
of scholars and great drinkers
but none could match the splendor
of the queen of argyle. 
so my lads i needs must leave you
my intentions not to grieve you,
nor indeed would i deceive
you for i'll see you in a while.
i must find a way to gain her
to court her and to tame her.
for i fear my heart's in danger
of the queen of argyle.

Queen of Connemara,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=508,"oh! my boat can safely float in the teeth of wind and weather
and outrace the fastest hooker between galway and kinsale
when the black floor of the ocean and the white foam rush together high she rides, in her pride, like a sea-gull through the gale
 oh she's neat! oh she's sweet! she's a beauty in ev'ry line! the queen of connemara is that bounding barque of mine
when she's loaded down with fish till the water lips the gunwale
not a drop she'll take on board her that would wash a fly away;
from the fleet she'll slip out swiftly like a greyhound from her kennel and she'll land her silver store the first at ould kinvara quay
there's a light shines out afar, and it keeps me from dismaying
when the skies are ink above us and the sea runs white with foam
in a cot in connemara there's a wife and wee one praying
to the one who walked the waters once, to send us safely home"
Raglan Road a.k.a. Dawning of the Day,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=301,"on raglan road of an autumn day
i saw her first and knew,
that her dark hair would weave a snare
that i might someday rue.
i saw the danger and i passed
along the enchanted way.
and i said,""let grief be a fallen leaf
at the dawning of the day.""
on grafton street in november, we
tripped lightly along the ledge
of a deep ravine where can be seen
the worth of passion play.
the queen of hearts still making tarts
and i not making hay;
oh, i loved too much and by such and such
is happiness thrown away.
i gave her gifts of the mind,
i gave her the secret signs,
that's known to the artists who have known
the true gods of sound and stone.
and her words and tint without stint
i gave her poems to say
with her own name there and her own dark hair
like clouds over fields of may.
on a quiet street where old ghosts meet
i see her walking now,
and away from me so hurriedly
my reason must allow.
that i had loved, not as i should
a creature made of clay,
when the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
his wings at the dawn of day."
Rambles of Spring,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=302,"i've a fine felt hat and a strong pair of brogues
and i've rosin in my pocket for my bow
my fiddle strings are new and i've learned a tune or two
and i'm well prepared to ramble i must go
there's a piercing wintry breeze blowing through the budding trees
and i've buttoned up me coat to keep me warm
and i'm on the road again with a suitcase in my hand
and my fiddle's snug up close beneath my arm
i'm as happy as a king when i catch a breath of spring
and the grass is growin'  green as winter ends
and the geese are on the wing as the thrushes start to sing
and i'm headed down the road to meet my friends
i have friends in every town as i ramble up and down
playin' music at the markets and the fairs
and the donkeys and the creels and the farmers makin' deals
and the yellow hatted tinkers sellin' wares
here's a health to one and all to the big and to the small
to the rich and poor alike to foe and friend
and when i return again may my foes be turned to friends
and may may peace and joy be with you until then"

but give me enough of the fine ould stuff that's made near galway bay
now policeman all from donegal and galway and leister too

at the foot of the hill there's a neat little still and the smoke goes up to the sky
from the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell of the sip they're brewin' nearby
oh it fills the air with perfume rare and betwixt both me and you
at home we'll roll you can take a bowl of the real ould mountain dew
now learned men who use the pen have wrote their praises high
it's sweet poteen (pacheen) from ireland's green distilled from wheat and rye
throw away your pills it'll cure all ills of pagan or christian or jew

Red Haired Mary,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=304,"as i was going to the fair at dingle
one fine morning last july
when going down the road before me,
a red haired girl i chanced to spy.
""keep your hands off red-haired mary,
her and i are to be wed.
we're seein' the priest this very morning,
and tonight we'll lie in a marriage bed.""
well i went up to her, says i, ""young lady,
me donkey, he will carry two.""
and she looked at me, her eyes a-twinkle,
and cheeks they were a rosey hue.
""well i thank you kindly, sir,"" she answered,
and then she tossed her bright hair,
""now seein' that you've got your donkey,
i will ride with you to the dingle fair.""
but when we reached the fair at dingle,
i took her hand for to say good-bye,
when a tinker he stepped up behind me,
and he hit me right in my left eye!
now i was feeling rather peevish,
and my poor old eye was sad and sore,
so i tapped him lightly with me hobnails,
and he flew back through tim murphy's door!
then a policeman, he came round the corner,
and he told me i had broke the law,
then me donkey kicked him in the ankle,
and he fell down and broke his jaw!
now he galloped off to find his father;
the tallest man i e'er did meet.
he 'gently' tapped me with his knuckles,
and now i'm missing two front teeth.
now this red haired girl, she kept on smiling.
she said, ""young man, i'll go with you
forget the priest this very morning,
tonight we'll lie in murphy's shed!
through the dingle fair we rode together,
my black eye and her red hair.
smilin' gaily at the tinkers,
by god we were a handsome pair"
Red Is the Rose,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=305,"red is the rose that in yonder garden grows,
and fair is the lily of the valley;
clear is the water that flows from the boyne
but my love is fairer than any.
come over the hills, my bonny irish lass
comer over the hills to your darling;
you choose the rose, love, and i'll make the vow
and i'll be your true love forever.
'twas down by killarney's green woods that we strayed
and the moon and the stars they were shining;
the moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair
and she swore she'd be my love forever.
it's not for the parting tht my sister pains
it's not for the grief of my mother,
""tis all for the loss of my bonny irish lass
that my heart is breaking forever."
Red Red Rose,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=563,"my love is like a red red rose
that's newly sprung in june
oh my love is like a melody
that's sweetly played in tune
as fair thou art my bonnie lass
so deep in love am i
and i will love thee still my dear
till all the seas gone dry
till all the seas gone dry my dear
and the rocks melt with the sun
and i will love thee still my love
while the sands of life shall run
and fare thee well my only love
and fare thee well a while
and i will come again my love
though 't'were ten thousand miles"
Red Rose Cafe,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=306,"they come from the forests and the factories too
and they all soon forget who they are.
the cares of the day are soon washed away
as they sit at a stool by the bar.
the girl with green eyes in the rolling stones shirt
doesn't look like she works on the land.
the man at the end, is a very good friend
of a man who sells cars second hand.
down at the red rose cafe in the harbour
there by the port just outside amsterdam.
everyone shares in the songs and the laughter.
everyone there is so happy to be there.
the salesmen relax with a few pints of beer
as they try not to talk about trade.
the poet won't write any verses tonight.
but he may sing a sweet serenade.
so pull up a chair and forget about life.
it's a good thing to do now and then
and if you like it here i have an idea
tomorrow let's all meet again."
Reel of the Flickering Light,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=307,"i was walkin' home one evenin'
i know this takes some believin'
i met a group of creatures
with the strangest lookin' features
a poor ould dog and a worm and a weed
and a fine ould pidgeon yes indeed
daddy longlegs jumped up sprite
and danced a reel
of the flickering light
round we go, heel to the toe
daddy longlegs jumped up sprite
and danced in a reel
of the flickering light
on his thin and wispy spindles
he was deft and he was nimble,
his eyes were scientific
and his dancin' was terrific.
the rats and the worms they made a din and the nettles in the corner took it in,
""oh god"" sez i,""tonight's the night we'll dance to the reel in the flickering light!""
round we go, heel to the toe
""oh god"" sez i,""tonight's the night we'll dance to the reel in the flickering light!""
then he looked at me directly
with two eyes that could dissect me,
and he asked me in a whisper
""have you got any sisters?""
""good god almighty' sez i to him
what sort of a man do you think i am?
i've only one and she's not your type, she wouldn't dance a reel in the flickering light!""
round we go, heel to the toe
""i've only one and she's not your type, she wouldn't dance a reel in the flickering light!""
says he
""does she come from another planet? does she have a bee in her bonnet?
does she do her daily duties? you never know we might be suited.""
and the rats and the worms began to laugh and some of them started shufflin' off.
we're goin' to have some fun tonight gettin' ready for the reel in the flickering light.
round we go, heel to the toe
we're goin' to have some fun tonight gettin' ready for the reel in the flickering light.
i could see he had no scruples
when i looked into his pupils,
they were purple or magenta like a statue during lent.
""i'll go and get her right away""
""good man"" says he,""now don't delay,
we're goin' to have some fun tonight."" then he flipped his legs in the flickering light.
round we go, heel to the toe
we're goin' to have some fun tonight."" then he flipped his legs in the flickering light.
then up stepped a red carnation
and they gave her an ovation.
she was warm and enchantin'
as she slowly started dancin'.
and the bright auld pigeon
peeld his eye
and the nettles and the weeds
began to sigh,
daddy longlegs said ""my, oh my, are we ready for the reel in the flickering light?""
round we go, heel to the toe
daddy longlegs said ""my, oh my,
are we ready for the reel in the flickering light?""
she was gentle, she was charmin'
and i heard him call her darlin'.
he was graceful as a whisper on his delicate legs of silver.
and the rats and the worms
were still as mice
and the poor auld pigeon
said ""that's nice""
a shimmering veil of a lovely bride
and they danced to the reel in the flickering light.
round we go, heel to the toe
a shimmering veil of a lovely bride
and they danced to the reel in the flickering light."
Rich Man's Garden,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=308,"on that day when first i saw you
how my young heart filled with joy
you were picking sweet primroses
when i chanced to pass you by
i felt some strange thing happen
and i felt something had changed
somehow i knew because of you
i'd never be the same
you lived in a rich man's garden
fairest flower of all that grew
in a land i had no part of
where no harm could fall on you
and  i never got to know you
for you never looked my way
so i left you in that garden
and i sadly walked away
you father he had riches
with nothing left to crave
a lord of all the people
with a soul cold as the grave
and i knew he's give no quarter
to one as poor as me
so i never crossed that garden
where i knew my heart to be
now the years have slipped behind me
and my hair has turned to grey
i still see you in that garden
on that far off summer day
you were six and i was seven
without a jacket to my name
how i loved you in that garden
but you never spoke my name"

these wives that i keep here
are just for ornament my dear  
in emerald green he robed his queen
to share with him his throne
mid eastern charms and waving palms
they'd shamrocks irish grown

but in his palace so fine
should rose for ireland pine

Rock on Rockall,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=313,"oh! the empire it is finished no foreign lands to seize
so the greedy eye of england is
stirring towards the seas
two hundred miles from donegal, there's a place that's called rockall
and the groping hands of whitehall
are grabbing at its walls
oh, rock on rockall, may you never fall for britain's greedy hands
oh you'll meet the same resistance
like you did in many lands
may the seagulls rise and pluck your eyes and the water crush your shell,
and the natural gas will burn your ass and blow you all to hell.
this rock is part of ireland
for it' s written in folklore
when finn maccool took a sod of grass he threw it to the fore,
when he tossed a pebble across the sea where ever did it fall,
for the sod became the isle of man
and the pebble' s called rockall.
oh the seas will not be silent
while britannia grabs the waves
and remember that the irish
will no longer be your slaves
and remember that britannia well
she rules the waves no more
so keep your hands off rockall
it's irish to the core."
Rocks of Bawn,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=314,"come all ye loyal heroes and listen on to me.
don't hire with any farmer till you know what your work will be
you will rise up early in the morning from the clear day light till the dawn
and you never will be able for to plough the rocks of bawn.
my shoes they are worn and my stockings they are thin
my heart is always trembling now for fear they might give in
my heart is always trembling now from clear daylight till the dawn
and i never will be able for to plough the rocks of bawn.
rise up, gallant sweeney, and get your horses hay
and give them a good feed of oats before they start away
don't feed them on soft turnip sprigs that grow on your green lawn
or they never will be able for to plough the rocks of bawn.
my curse upon you, sweeney boy, you have me nearly robbed
you're sitting by the fireside now, your feet upon the hob
you're sitting by the fireside now, from clear daylight till dawn
and you never will be able for to plough the rocks of bawn
i wish the sergeant-major would send for me in time
and place me in some regiment all in my youth and prime
i'd fight for ireland's glory now, from the clear daylight till dawn
before i would return again to plough the rocks of bawn."
Rocky Road to Dublin,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=315,"in the merry month of june from my home i started
left the girls of tuam nearly broken-hearted
saluted father dear, kissed my darlin' mother
drank a pint of beer my grief and tears to smother
then off to reap the corn, and leave where i was born
i cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghost and goblin,
brand new pair of brogues i rattled o'er the bogs
and frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to dublin,
one, two, three, four five, hunt the hare and turn her
down the rocky roaad, and all the ways to dublin
whack fol-lol-de-ra.
in mullingar that night i rested limbs so weary,
started by daylight next morning light and airy,
took a drop of the pure, to keep my heart from sinking,
that's the paddy's cure, whene'er he's on for drinking,
to see the lassies smile, laughing all the while,
at my curious style, would set your heart a-bubbling,
they asked if i was hired, the wages i required,
till i was almost tired of the rocky road to dublin.   
in dublin next arrived, i thought it such a pity,
to be so soon deprived a view of that fine city,
then i took a stroll out among the quality,
my bundle it was stole in a nice locality;
something crossed my mind, then i looked behind,
no bundle could i find upon me stick a-wobblin',
enquiring for the rogue, they said my connaught brogue
wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to dublin.   
from there i got away my spirits never failing,
landed on the quay as the ship was sailing,
captain at me roared, said that no room had he,
when i jumped aboard, a cabin found for paddy
down among the pigs, i played some funny rigs
danced some hearty jigs, all around the water bubblin'
when off to holyhead i wished that i was dead,
or better far, instead, on the rocky road to dublin.   
the boys of liverpool, when we safely landed,
called myself a fool, i could no longer stand it;
blood began to boil, temper i was losin'
poor old erin's isle they were all abusin'
""hurrah my soul!"" says i, shillelagh i let fly,
some galway boys were by, saw i was a hobblin'
then with a loud hurray, they joined in the affray,
we quickly cleared the way, on the rocky road to dublin.  "
Roddy McCorley,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=316,"oh see the fleet foot host of men who sped with faces wan
from farmsead and from fisher's scot down to the banks of bann
they come with vengeance in their eyes too last, too late are they
for young roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of taum (toom) today
up the narrow street he steps smiling proud and young
about that hemp rope 'round his neck, his golden ringlets clung
there was ne're a tear in his blue eyes, both glad  and bright are they
for young roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of taum today
when he last stepped up that street, his shining pike in hand
behind him marches in grim array a stalward honest band
for antrim town, for antrim town, he led them to the fray
for young roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of taum today
there was ne're a one of all your dead so bravely fell in fray
as he who marches to his death on the bridge of taum today
true to the last, true to the last, he treads the upward way
and young roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of taum today"

Rory O'Moore,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=318,"young rory o'moore courted kath a leen bawn
he was bold as a hawk and she soft as the dawn
he wished in his heart pretty kathleen to please

reproof on her lip but a smile in her eye

you've thwarted my heart for this many a day
and 'tis pleased that i am why not to be sure

and i've thrashed for your sake dinny grimes and james duff
and i've made myself drinking your health quite a baste
so i think after that i may talk to a priest.""

so soft and so white without freckle or speck
and he looked in her eyes that were beaming with light
and he kissed her sweet lips son't you think he was right?

that's eight times today that you've kissed me before!""
""than here goes another!"" says he, ""to be sure
for there's luck in odd numbers"" says rory o'moore."
Rose of Mooncoin,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=319,"oh how sweet 'tis to roam by the suir's lovely stream
and to hear the birds coo 'neath the morning sunbeams
where the thrush and the robin their sweet notes enjoin

by your water's so sweet sounds the lark's merry song
on your green banks i'll wander where first i did join
with you lovely molly, the rose of mooncoin

to know that we two forever must part
i'll think of you molly while sun and moon shine

far away from the banks of her dear irish home
where the fisherman sports with his small boat and line
on the banks of the suir that flows down by mooncoin

as oft times we wandered in the cool morning air
where the roses are blooming and the lillies entwine
on the banks of the suir that flows down by mooncoin  "

she was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
but 'twas not her beauty alone that won me
oh no was the truth in her eyes ever dawning

when i won the heart of the rose of tralee  "
Rose Tattoo,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=571,"the pictures tell the story
this life had many shades
i'd wake up every morning and before i'd start each day
i'd take a drag from last night's cigarette
that smoldered in it's tray
down a little something and then be on my way
i traveled far and wide
laid this head in many ports
i was guided by a compass
i saw beauty to the north
i drew the tales of many lives
wore the faces of my own
i had these memories all around me
so i wouldn't be alone
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn't have a clue
i ain't winning no one over
i'll wear it just for you
i've got your name written here
in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
in a rose tattoo
i've got your name written here
in a rose tattoo
this one's for the mighty sea
mischief, gold and piracy
this ones for the man that raised me
taught me sacrifice and bravery
this one's for our favorite game
black and gold, we wave the flag
this one's for my family name
with pride i'll wear it to the grave
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn't have a clue
i ain't winning no one over

this one means the most to me
it stays here for eternity
a ship that always stays the course
an anchor for my every choice
a rose that shines down from above
i signed and sealed these words in blood
i heard them once, sung in a song
it played again and we sang along
you'll always be there with me
even if you're gone
you'll always have my love
our memory will live on
some may be from showing up
others are from growing up
sometimes i was so messed up and didn't have a clue

Roseville Fair,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=321,"oh the night was clear, and stars were shining
and the moon rose up, so quiet in the sky
and the people gathered 'round, and the band was tuning
i can hear them now, playin' ""coming through the rye""
and we danced all night, to the fiddle and the banjo
the driftin' tunes, seemed to fill the air
so long ago but i still remember
we fell in love, at the roseville fair
you were dressed in blue, and you looked so lovely
just a gentle flower of a hometown girl
and you took my hand, and we stepped to the music
with a single smile, you became my world  
well we courted well, and we courted dearly
and we rocked for hours on the front porch chair
and a year went by, since the day i met you
and i made you mine, at the roseville fair

so here's a song, for all you lovers
her's a tune that you can share
may you dance all night to the fiddle and the banjo
the way we did, at the roseville fair"

then get this half dozen stout fellows and let them all stagger and go
and dig a great hole in the meadow and in it put rosin the bow
and in it put rosin the bow
and in it put rosin the bow
and dig a great hole in the meadow
and in it put rosin the bow
then get ye two noggins of whiskey put one at me head and me toe
with a diamond ring scratch upon them the name of old rosin the bow
the name of old rosin the bow
the name of old rosin the bow
with a diamond ring scratch upon them
the name of old rosin the bow
i've only this one consolation as out of this world i go
i know that the next generation will resemble old rosin the bow
will resemble old rosin the bow
will resemble old rosin the bow
i know that the next generation
will resemble old rosin the bow
i fear that old tyrant approaching that cruel remorseless old foe
i'll raise up a glass in his honor have a drink with old rosin the bow
have a drink with old rosin the bow

Sally Garden,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=324,"tune: maids of the mourne shore, trad
it was down by the sally gardens, my love and i did meet.
she crossed the sally gardens with little snow-white feet.
she bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree,
but i was young and foolish, and with her did not agree.
in a field down by the river, my love and i did stand
and on my leaning shoulder, she laid her snow-white hand.
she bid me take life easy , as the grass grows on the weirs
but i was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.
down by the sally gardens, my love and i did meet.

Sally MacLennane,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=457,"well jimmy played harmonica in the pub where i was born
he played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
he soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
and they all looked very happy in the morning
well jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
when he's had too many powers
so sad to see the grieving
of the people that i'm leaving
and he took the road for god knows in the morning
 we walked him to the station in the rain
we kissed him as we put him on the train
and we sang him a song of times long gone
though we knew that we'd be seeing him again (far away)
sad to say i must be on my way
so buy me beer and whiskey cause i'm going far away (far away)
i'd like to think of me returning when i can
to the greatest little boozer and to sally maclennane
the years went by the times had changed
i grew to be a man i learned to love the virtues
of sweet sally maclennane
i took the jeers and drank the beers
and crawled back home at dawn
i ended up a barman in the morning
i played the pump and took the hump
and watered whiskey down
i talked of whores and horses
to the men who drank the brown
i heard them say that jimmy's making money far away
and some people left for heaven without warning
when jimmy came back home
he was surprised that they were gone
he asked me all the details
of the train that they went on
some people they are scared to croak
but jimmy drank until he choked
and took the road for heaven in the morning"

Scotland the Brave,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=565,"hark when the night is falling
hear! hear the pipes are calling,
loudly and proudly calling,
down thro' the glen.
there where the hills are sleeping,
now feel the blood a-leaping,
high as the spirits
of the old highland men.
towering in gallant fame,
scotland my mountain hame,
high may your proud
standard gloriously wave,
land of my high endeavour,
land of the shining rivers,
land of my heart for ever,
scotland the brave.
high in the misty highlands,
out by the purple islands,
brave are the hearts that beat
beneath scottish skies.
wild are the winds to meet you,
staunch are the friends that greet you,
kind as the love that shines
from fair maidens' eyes.
far off in sunlit places,
sad are the scottish faces,
yearning to feel the kiss
of sweet scottish rain.
where tropic skies are beaming,
love sets the heart a-dreaming,
longing and dreaming for the homeland again."
Scotsman’s Kilt,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=326,"oh a scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair
and one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share
he fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet
and he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street
ring ding diddle dliddle add  e o
ring ding diddily i oh
(repeat last line of verse)
well about that time two young and lovely lassies passed him by
and one looked to the other with a twinkle in her eye
""do you see yon sleepin' scotsman so strong and handsome built?
well i wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilt""
they crept up to the sleepin' scotsman quiet as could be
they lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see
and there behold for them to view beneath the scotsman's skirt
there was nothin' more than god had graced him with upon his birth
well they marvelled for a moment and one said ""we must be gone.
let's leave a present for our friend before we move along""
as a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied up in a bow
about the bonny part the scotsman's kilt had lift and shown
well the scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled toward the trees
he lifted up his kilt and then he gawks at what he sees
and in the voice of wonderment at what's before his eyes
""akk lad i don't know where you've been but i see you've won first prize""
our scottish friend still clad in kilt continued down the street
he hadnâ’t gone 10 yards or more
when a girl he chanced to meet
she said,â” iâ’ve heard whatâ’s under there,
please tell me if itâ’s so.â”
he said,â”why donâ’t you reach right up,
and give yourself a go?â”
she stuck her hand right up his kilt
and great was her surprise.
she looked up at the scotsman
he had twinkles in his eyes
she cried,â”why sir thatâ’s gruesome!â”
and then she heard him roar
he said,â”if you reach up once again
youâ’ll find itâ’s grew some more!â”
the scotmanâ’s hands were numb with drink
his head was spinning â‘round.
he couldnâ’t get that ribbon off
so homeward he was bound
his wife she caught a flash of blue
as he took off his clothes
and it piqued her curiosity
as you might well suppose.
well the she asked that scotsman
where heâ’d been and what heâ’d done
he said there was a contest at the pub
and that heâ’d won
she cried,â” you did not show that thing
in front of all those men?â”
â“i did not show it all my love
but just enough to win.â”"
Seamus O'Brien,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=442,"oh, sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn'
as peeps through the curtains of night
and the voice of the nightingale singing his tone
while the stars seem to smile with delight
oh nature it lingers in silent repose
and the sweet breath of summer is come
while i said to [...] seamus i knows
how sad and unhappy i am
oh seamus o'brien why don't you come home
you won't know how happy i'd be
i have one darling wish love and that's you would come
and ever be happy with me
i'd smile when you smile and i'd weep when you weep
and i'd give you a kiss for a kiss
and all the fond vows i have made you i'll keep
what more can a promise than this
does a sea have such brightness such beautiful charms
that you'll heart no leave them for me
oh why did i let you out of my arms
like a bird that was caged and set free
oh seamus o'brien why don't you come home
you won't know how happy i'd be
i have one darling wish love
and that's you would come
and ever be happy with me
oh seamus o'brien i'm loving you yet
my heart is still trusting and kind
it was you who first took it, how can you forget,
that love for another you'd find
now know if you break it what sorrow and pain
i'll then have a duty to do
if you bring it to me i shall mend it again
and trust to old seamus to you
oh seamus o'brien why don't you come home
you won't know how happy i'd be i have one darling wish love and that's you would come and ever live happy with me"
Sean South of Garryowen,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=327,"'twas on a dreary new year's eve when the shades of night fell down
a lorry load of volunteers approached a border town
there were men from dublin and from cork, fermanagh and tyrone
but the leader was a limerick lad, sean south of garryowen.
and as they moved along the street up to the barrack door
the scorned the danger they would meet, the fate that lay in store
they were fighting for old ireland, to save their very own
and the leader of that gallant band was south of garryowen.
but the sergeant foiled their daring plan, he spied them through the door
from the guns and all the rifles too, a hail of death did pour
and when that awful night was o'er two men lay cold as stone
there was one from near the border and one from garryowen.
no more he'll hear the seagull cry, or the murmuring shannon's tide
for he fell beneath a northern sky, brave o'hanlon by his side
he's gone to join that gallant band of plunkett, pierce and tone
another martyr for old ireland, sean south of garryowen."

Seven Ould Ladies,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=328,"oh dear, what can the matter be?
seven ould ladies are stuck in the lavat'ry
they were there from sunday 'till saturday
no body knew they were there
the first one wnt in it was ould mrs. draper
she finsihed the job but could not find the paper
the only thing there was a brick layer's scaper
and nobody knew she was there  
the next one went in it ws ould mrs, pimm
she sat on the bowl and she settled right in
she went to het up but got stuck to the brim
and nobody knew they were there  
the next one went in it was ould mrs. hamill
she held it so long i thought she was a camel
she sat down so quick she was goosed on the handle
and nobody knew they were there  
the next one went in it was old mrs. border
delayed on her entry as she had no quarter
he butt was so big she submerged in the water
and nobody knew they were there  
the next one went in was a woman named joslyn
she had to go quick and really was hustlin'
the seat was still up, she sat right on the porcelan
and nobody knew they were there  
then murphy went in with such urgency darted
thought she had to shit but she only farted
she had some relief but was still broken hearted
and nobody knew they were there  
the last one went in it was old mrs. mason
the stall were all full so she wizzed in the basin
that was the one ian paisley washed his face in
and just what was he doin' there?"
Shamrock and the Rose,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=469," thanks to michael wheeler for tracking down the author for this title. since i'm unfamiliar with the song i'm not sure if the lyrics listed below are their original lyrics or they are penned from fair isle folk, 1987. any info will be gratelfully accepted
one day as i walked through a garden of flowers,
for nature her beauty bestowed
and among the green bushes i wandered my way
i noticed a shamrock and rose
for the flowers were all blooming
and shouting away in a low and deep tone of their own
and the shamrock was pleading its own country's cause
to the rose in a heartbroken tone:
'if my love of you were treasure, forgive me this pleasure:
i stood by your side; i defeated your foes
then why should you slight me  i've proven all flight me
' said ireland's green shamrock to england's red rose
'they say you are weary of my discontent
they say that your sympathy's strong
but 'cause you were cold for one hour on this earth
for the ages of wrong you have done...
'if my love of you were treasure
forgive me this pleasure: i stood by your side;
i defeated your foes
then why should you slight me  i've proven all flight me
' said ireland's green shamrock to england's red rose
'o lo that the thousands in exile today
it's no better there than here
who gave their lifeblood and where are they today?
exiled from the land of their birth...
'if my love of you were treasure
forgive me this pleasure:
i stood by your side; i defeated your foes
then why should you slight me  i've proven all flight me
' said ireland's green shamrock to england's red rose"
Shanagolden,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=329,"tune: i gave my love a cherry, the twelfth of never
the cold winds from the mountains are calling soft to me,
the smell of scented heather brings bitter memories:
a wild and lonely eagle up in the summer sky,
flies high o'er shanagolden, where my love willie lies.
i met him in the winter time when snow was on the ground
the irish hills were peaceful and love was all around.
scarcely twenty years old, a young man in his prime.
we were married, darling willie by the eve of christmas time.
do you remember willie, we walked the moonlit road
i held you in my arms, love, i would never let you go.
our hands they were entwined, my love, all in the pale moonlight,
by the fields of shanagolden on a lonely winter's night.
then came the call to arms, love, the heather was aflame.
down from the silent mountains, the saxon strangers came.
i held you in my arms then, my young heart wild with fear,
in the fields by shanagolden, in the springtime of the year.
you fought them, darling willie, all through the summer days.
i heard the rifles firing in the mountains far away
i held you in my arms then, your blood ran free and bright,
and you died in shanagolden, on a lonely summer's night.
but that was long ago, love, now our son grows fine and tall;
the hills they are at peace again: the saxon strangers gone.
there's roses growing on your grave, there's an eagle in the sky ,
flying high o'er shanagolden, where my love willie lies."
She Moved Through the Fair,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=330,"my young love said to me, ""my mother won't mind
and my father won't slight you for your lack of kind""
and she stepped away from me and this she did say:
it will not be long, love, till our wedding day""
as she stepped away from me and she moved through the fair
and fondly i watched her move here and move there
and then she turned homeward with one star awake
like the swan in the evening moves over the lake
the people were saying, no two e'er were wed
but one had a sorrow that never was said
and i smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
and that was the last that i saw of my dear.
last night she came to me, my dead love came in
so softly she came that her feet made no din
as she laid her hand on me and this she did say
""it will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"""

and the mountains so grand in my own native land

but to seek a home for my own true love
on the shores of amerikay
and when i am bidding my last farewell
the tears like rain will blind
to think of my friends in my own native land
and the home i'm leaving behind
but if i should die on a foreign land
and be buried so far, far away
no fond mother's tears will be shed o're my grave

Sister Josephine,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=332,"oh, sister josephine
what do all these policemen mean
by coming to the convent in their grim limousine
after sister josephine?
while you, sister josephine
you sit with your boots up on the altar screen
you smoke one last cigar
what a funny nun you are
the policemen say that josephine's a burglar in disguise
fifteen years or more been on the run
the sisters don't believe it:
no, that can't be josephine
just think about her tenderness towards the younger nuns
oh, sister josephine
they're searching the chapel where you've been seen
the nooks and the crannies of the nun's canteen
after sister josephine
while you, sister josephine
take a farewell sip of benedictine
before your au revoir
what a funny nun you are
admittedly her hands were strong and hairy
and embellished with a curious tattoo
admittedly her voice was on the deep side
she seems to shave more often than the other sisters do
oh, sister josephine
founder of the convent poker team
they're looking through your bundles of playboy magazines
after sister josephine
while you, sister josephine
you give a farewell sniff of benzedrine
to the convent budgerigar
what a funny nun you are
no longer will her snores be heard in chapel during prayers
nor her lustful moanings fill the stilly night
no more empty bottles of altar wine come clunking from her cell
no longer will the cloister toilet seat stand upright
oh, sister josephine
slipping through their fingers like vaseline
leaving them to clutch your empty crinoline
after sister josephine
while you, sister josephine
streaking through the suburbs when last seen
dressed only in your bvd's and rosary
what a funny nun you seem to be"

Skibbereen,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=333,"o, father dear, i often hear you speak of erin's isle,
her her lofty scenes her valleys green, her mountains rude and wild
you said it is a lovely place wherein a prince might dwell,
why have you then forsaken her, the reason to me tell?
my son, i loved our native land with energy and pride
until a blight fell on my crops my and sheep and cattle died,
the rents and taxes were too high, i could not them redeem,
and that's the cruel reason why i left old skibbereen.
it's well i do remember on a bleak november's day,
the landlord and the sheriff came to drive us all away;
they set my house on fire with their cursed english spleen
and that's another reason why i left old skibbereen.
your mother, too, god rest her soul, lay on the snowy ground,
she fainted in her anguish seein' the desolation round.
she never rose, but passed away from sleep to mortal dream,
and found a quiet grave, my boy, in dear old skibbereen.
it's well i do remember the year of forty-eight,
when we arose with erin's boys to fight against our fate;
i was hunted through the mountains as a traitor to the queen,
and that's another reason that i left old skibbereen.
oh father dear, the day will come when in answer to the call
each irishman with feeings stern will answer one and all,
i'll be the man to lead the van, beneath our flag of green,
and loud and high we'll raise the cry,"" remember skibbereen!"""
Skye Boat Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=503," speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
onward! the sailors cry;
carry the lad that's born to be king
over the sea to skye.
loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
thunderclouds rend the air;
baffled, our foes stand by the shore,
follow they will not dare.
though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
ocean's a royal bed. rocked in the deep,
flora will keep watch by your weary head.
many's the lad fought on that day,
well the claymore could wield,
when the night came, silently lay dead in culloden's field.
burned are their homes, exile and death
scatter the loyal men;
yet e'er the sword cool in the sheath
charlie will come again."
Slattery,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=429,"you've heard o' julius caesar,
and the great napolean, too,
an' how the cork militia beat the turks at waterloo;
but there's a page of glory
that, as yet, remains uncut,
an' that's the martial story o' the shlathery's mounted fut.
this gallant corps was organized
by shlathery's eldest son.
a noble-minded poacher,
wid a double- breasted gun;
an' many a head was broken,
aye, an' many an eye was shut,
whin practisin' manoeuvres in the shlathery's mounted fut.
cho: an' down from the mountains came
the squadrons an' platoons,
four-an'-twinty fightin' min,
an' a couple o' sthout gossoons,
an' whin we marched behind the dhrum to patriotic tunes,
we felt that fame would gild the name
o' shlathery's light dragoons.
well, first we reconnoithered round
o' o'sullivan's shebeen--
it used to be 'the shop house,
' but we call it, 'the canteen;'
but there we saw a notice
which the bravest heart unnerved--
'all liquor must be settled
for before the dhrink is served.'
so on we marched,
but soon again each warrior's heart grew pale,
for risin' high in front o' us we saw the county jail;
an' whin the army faced about,
'twas just in time to find,
a couple o' policemin had surrounded s behind.
still, from the mountains came the squadrons and platoons,
four-an'-twinty fightin' min, an' a couple o' sthout gossoons,
says shlathery, 'we must circumvent
these bludgeonin' bosthoons
or else it sames they'll take the names
o' shlathery's light dragoons.'
'we'll cross the ditch,' our leader cried,
'an' take the foe in flank,'
but yells of consthernation
here arose from every rank,
for posted high upon a tree
we very plainly saw,
'threspassers prosecuted, in accordance wid' the law.'
'we're foiled!' exclaimed bold shlathery, '
here ends our grand campaign,
'tis merely throwin' life away
to face that mearin' dhrain,
i'm not as bold as lions, but i'm braver nor a hin,
an' he that fights and runs away will live
an' back to the mountains
went the squadrons an' platoons,
four-an'-twinty fightin' min, an'
a couple o' sthout gossoons,
the band was playin' cautiously their patriotic tunes;
to sing the fame, if rather lame
o' shlathery's light dragoons.
we reached the mountains safely
tho' all stiff and sore with cramp
each took a neat of whiskey
straight to dissipate the damp.
and when their pipes were loaded up
o'slattery up and said
today's immortal fight will be remembered by the dead.
'i never will forget,' said he while this brave heart shall beat
'the eager way ye followed when i headed the retreat.
ye've heard the soldier's maxim
when desisting from the fight
best be a coward for five minutes
than a dead man all your life.'
so there in the mountains rest the squadrons and platoons
the four and twenty fighting men and a couple of stout gossoons
they march no more so martially
to patriotic tunes
but all the same they sing the fame of
o'slattery's light dragoons."
Slievamon,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=334,"alone, all alone, by the wave-washed strand
all alone in the crowded hall.
the hall is gay, and the waves they are grand.
but my heart is not here at all.
it flies far away, by night and by day
to the times and the joys that are gone.
and i will never forget the sweet maiden i met
in the valley near slievenamon.
it was not the grace of her queenly air
nor her cheek of the rose's glow
nor her soft black eyes, not her flowing hair
nor was it her lily white brow,
twas the soul of truth, and of melting ruth
and the smile like a summer dawn
that sold my heart away on a soft summer day
in the valley near slievenamon.
in the festive hall, by the starwashed shore,
ever my restless spirit cries.
""my love, on, my love, shall i ne'er see you more.
and my land, will you never uprise?
by night and by day, i ever, ever pray
while lonely my life flow on
to see our flag unfurled and my true love to enfold
in the valley near slievenamon."
Slieve Galleon Braes,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=335,"as i was walkin' one morning all in the month of may

full of times i have wandered with my dog and my gun,
i'd ramble these mountains and your valleys for fun,
but those days they now all over and i can no longer stay
so farewell unto you bonny, bonny, slieve galleon braes.
how oft in the evening with the sun all in the west
i walked hand in hand with the one i love best
but the hopes of youth are ended and i am far away
so farewell unto you bonny bonny slieve galleon braes
'tis not for the want of employment at home
that causes the son of ould ireland to roam,
but the rates were gettin' higher and i could no longer stay
so farewell unto you bonny, bonny, slieve galleon braes.
our isle it will be green and our cottages be gay
our children will be clothed and our wives will drink strong tea
oh you tyrannising landlords - i will no longer stay

Snowy Breasted Pearl,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=441,"there's a colleen fair as may
for a year and for a day i have sought by every way
her heart to gain there's no art of tongue or eye
fond youths with maidens try
but i've tried with ceaseless sigh
and tried in vain.
if to france or far off spain
she crossed the watery main
to see her face again t
he seas i'd brave
and if it's heaven's decree
that mine she'll never be
may the son of mary me in mercy save.
but a kiss with welcome bland
and the touch of thy fair hand
are all that i demand
wouldst thou not spurn
for if not mine dear girl
my snowy breasted pearl
may i never from the fair
with life return.

Soldier's Song,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=336,"we'll sing a song, a soldier's song,
with cheering rousing ,
as round our blazing fires we throng,
the starry heavens o'er us;
impatient for the coming fight,
and as we wait the morning's light,
here in the silence of the night,
we'll chant a soldier's song.
soldiers are we
whose lives are pledged to ireland;
some have come
from a land beyond the wave.
sworn to be free,
no more our ancient sire land
shall shelter the despot or the slave.
tonight we man the gap of danger
in erin's cause, come woe or weal
'mid cannons' roar and rifles peal,
we'll chant a soldier's song
in valley green, on towering crag,
our fathers fought before us,
and conquered 'neath the same old flag
that's proudly floating o'er us.
we're children of a fighting race,
that never yet has known disgrace,
and as we march, the foe to face,
we'll chant a soldier's song    
sons of the gael! men of the pale!
the long watched day is breaking;
the serried ranks of inisfail
shall set the tyrant quaking.
our camp fires now are burning low;
see in the east a silv'ry glow,
out yonder waits the saxon foe,
so chant a soldier's song.    "
Some Say The Devil Is Dead,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=396,"some say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead,

katie, she is tall and thin, tall and thin, tall and thin.
katie, she is tall and thin. she likes a drop of brandy.
drinks it in the bed at night, drinks it in the bed at night, drinks it in the bed at night.
it makes her nice and randy. 
my man is six foot tall, six foot tall, six foot tall,
my man is six foot tall, he likes his sugar candy.
goes to bed at six o'clock, goes to bed at six o'clock, goes to bed at six o'clock.
he's lazy, fat and dandy. 
my wife, she has a hairy thing, a hairy thing, a hairy thing.
my wife, she has a hairy thing, she showed it to me sunday.
she bought it in the furrier shop, bought it in the furrier shop, bought it in the furrier shop.

silver-winged they fly they know the call of freedom in their breasts
saw black head against the sky where twisted rocks they run to the sea
living on your western shore
saw summer sunsets, asked for more
i stood by your atlantic sea
and sang a song for ireland
drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
saw one touch the bow he played a reel which seemed so grand and gay
stood on dingle beach and cast in wild foam we found atlantic bass  
talking all the day wth true friends who try to make you stay
telling jokes and news singing songs to pass the time away
watched the galway salmon run like silver dancing, darting in the sun 
dreaming in the night i saw a land where no one had to fight
waking in your dawn i saw you crying in the morning light
sleeping where the falcons fly they twist and turn all in your air-blue sky  "
Sonny's Dream,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=339,"sonny lives on a farm on a wide open space
kick off your shoes son, stay out of the race
lay down your head by the soft river bed
sonny still can remember the words his mama said   
oh, sonny don't go away, i am here all alone
your daddy's the sailor never comes home
the nights get so long, and the silence goes on
and i'm feeling so tired, i'm not all that strong
sonny works on the land tough he's barely a man
not much to do, he does just what he can
sits by the window in his room by the stairs
watches the waves gently wash on the pier   
and it's a hundred miles to town, sonny's never been there
and he goes to the highway and stands there and stares
and the mail comes at four and the mailman is old
oh, but he still dreams his dreams full of silver and gold   
sonny's dreams can't be real, they're just stories he's read
they're just stars in his eyes, they're just dreams in his head
and he's hungry inside for the wide world outside
and i know i can't hold him though i've tried and i've tried   
many years have passed on, sonny's old and alone
his daddy the sailor never came home
sometimes he wonders what his life would have been
but from the grave mama still haunts his dreams   "
Sound the Pibroch,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=560,"sound the pibroch loud and high
frae john o' groats to the isle of skye
let all the clans, their slogans cry
and rise to follow charlie
hatcheen-fo am fo am and fo am
hatcheen-fo am fo am and fo am
hatcheen-fo am fo am and fo am
rise and follow charlie
and see a small devoted band
by dark loch shiel have ta'en their stand
and proudly vow with heart and hand
to fight for royal charlie
on dark culloden's field of gore
hark! hark! they shout claymore! claymore!
they bravely fight, what can they more?
they die for royal charlie
no more we'll see such deeds again
deserted is each highland glen
lonely cairns lie over the men
the men who died for charlie"
South Austrailia,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=340,"in south australia i was born!
heave away! haul away!
south australia round cape horn!
we're bound for south australia!
heave away, you rolling king,
heave away! haul away!
all the way you'll hear me sing
we're bound for south australia!
as i walked out one morning fair,
it's there i met miss nancy blair.
i shook her up, i shook her down,
i shook her round and round the town.
there ain't but one thing grieves my mind,
it's to leave miss nancy blair behind.
and as you wallop round cape horn,
you'll wish to christ you'd never been born!
up the coast to vallipo,
northward on to callao.
it's back again to liverpool,
i spent me pay like a bloody fool!
i'm liverpool born and liverpool bred,
long in the arm and thick in the head.
oh, rock and roll me over boys,
let's get this damn job over boys."
Spancil Hill,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=341,"last night as i lay dreamin' of pleasant days gone by
me mind been bent on ramblin' to ireland i did fly
i stepped on board a vision  and i followed with a will
when at last i came to anchor at the cross at spancil hill
it was on the twenty third of june the day before the fair
where ireland's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
the young, the old, the brave and the bold came their duty to fulfill
at the little church at clooney a mile from spancil hill
i went to see my neighbors to see what they might say
the old ones they were dead and gone the young ones turnin' grey
i met with tailor quigley, he's as bold as ever still
for he used to make me breeches when i lived in spancil hill
i paid a flying visit to my first and only love
she's as white as any lilly and as gentle as a dove
she threw her arms around me sayin', ""johnny, i love you still!""
she's ned the farmer's daughter and the pride of spancil hill
i dreamt i hugged and kissed her as in the days of yore
she said, ""johnny, you're only jokin' as manys the times before!""
the cock he crew in the mornin' he crewed so loud and shrill
and i was back in california many miles from spancil hill"
Spanish Lady,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=342,"as i went down to dublin city,
at the hour of twelve at night,
who should i see but a spanish lady,
washing her feet by candlelight.
first she washed them,
then she dried them over a fire of amber coal,
in all my life i ne'er did see
a maid so sweet about the soul
whack fol the toora, toora laddy
whack fol the foora loora lay
as i came back through dublin city
at the hour of half past eight
who should i spy but the spanish lady
brushing her hair in the broad daylight.
first she tossed it, then she brushed it,
on her lap was a silver comb
in all my life i ne'er did see
a maid so fair since i did roam. 
as i went back through dublin city
as the sun began to set
who should i spy but the spanish lady
catching a moth in a golden net.
when she saw me then she fled me
lifting her petticoat over her knee
in all my life i ne'er did see
a maid so shy as the spanish lady. 
i've wandered north and i've wandered south
through stonybatter and patrick's close
up and around the gloucester diamond
and back by napper tandy's house.
old age has laid her hand on me
cold as a fire of ashy coals
in all my life i ne'er did see
a maid so sweet as the spanish lady.   "
Spinning Wheel,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=430," mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning
close by the window young eileen is spinning
bent o'er the fire her blind grandmother sitting
is crooning and moaning and drowsily knitting.
merrily cheerily noiselessly whirring
swings the wheel spins the wheel while the foot's stirring
sprightly and lightly and merrily ringing
trills the sweet voice of the young maiden singing.
eileen, a chara, i hear someone tapping
'tis the ivy dear mother against the glass flapping
eileen, i surely hear somebody sighing
'tis the sound mother dear of the autumn winds dying.
what's the noise that i hear at the window i wonder?
'tis the little birds chirping the holly bush under
what makes you be shoving and moving your stool on?
and singing all wrong the old song of the 'coolin'?
there's a form at the casement the form of her true love
and he whispers with face bent i'm waiting for you love
get up on the stool through the lattice step lightly
and we'll rove in the grove while the moon's shining brightly.
the maid shakes her head on her lips lays her fingers
steps up from the stool longs to go and yet lingers
a frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother
puts her foot on the stool spins the wheel with the other
lazily, easily, now swings the wheel round slowly and lowly is heard now the reel's sound noiseless and light to the lattice above her the maid steps, then leaps to the arms of her lover."
Star of the County Down,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=343,"near bainbridge town in the county down
one morning in last july
down a boreen green came a sweet colleen
and she smiled as she passed me by
from banrty bay up to derry quay
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down
she looked so sweet from her bare two feet
to the sheen of her nut brown hair
a coaxing elf and i shook myself
for to she she was really there
from banrty bay up to derry quay
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down
the onward sped and i truned my head
and i looked with a feeling rare
i said says i to a passer by
""who's the maid with the nut brown hair?""
he smiled at me and he said, said he
""she's the gem of ireland's crown.
rosie mccann from the banks of the bann
she's the star of the county down!""
from banrty bay up to derry quay
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down
the harvest fair she'll be surely there
so i'll dress in my sunday clothes
with my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
and a smile for my nut brown rose
no pipe i'll smoke, no horse i'll yoke
till my plow is a rust colored brown
and a smiling bride by my own fireside
sits the star of the county down
from banrty bay up to derry quay
from galway to dublin town
no maid i've seen like the brown colleen
that i met in the county down"
Staten Island,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=344,"we're the poor, the huddled masses
we have crossed the lonely sea
left the old world for the new world
left the old ways to be free
we sailed our ship up the hudson river
to wild atlantic, we said farewell
to staten island when we landed
there we had our tale to tell
we left our homes in forty seven
turned our back against the wind
from our ships of creaking timber
we bid farewell to a famished land 
with heavy hearts we left behind us
memories of better days
old men talking, children laughing
as we danced the night away  
still we hear their voices calling
on the wind we hear the sound
friends and loved ones old and new ones
lie beneath the famine mound  
now those days are far behind us
now our spirits have grown strong
in this land that gave us freedom
and the wind to carry on"
Stone Outside Dan Murphy's Door (the),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=345,"there's a sweet garden spot in my memory
it's the place we were born in and reared
it's been long years since then that we left it
but return there we will if we're spared
our friends and companions of childhood
would assemble each night at the store
round dan murphy's shop, and how often we's stop
on the stone outside dan murphy's door
those days in our hearts we will cherish
contented although we were poor
and the songs that were sung
in the days we were young
on the stone outside dan murphy's door
when our day's work was over we'd meet there
in the winter or spring just the same
then the boys and the girls all together
would join in some innocent game
dan murphy would take down his fiddle
while his daughter looked after the store
the music did ring and sweet songs we would sing
on the stone outside dan murphy's door   
back again do my thoughts often wander
to the scenes of our childhood's home
the friends and companions we left there
it was poverty caused us to roam
since then in this life we have prospered
but still in our hearts we feel sore
for memory will fly to those days long gone by
and the stone outside dan murphy's door"
Stone Throwers Ballad,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=516,"on old tipp hill in syracuse in 1925
alderman huckle ryan displayed the irish pride
the traffic light on tompkins
and milton it was said
to put the green of ireland
on top of englands red
the request it soon was granted
but met an awful fate
from state traffic regulations
and government red tape
the red was on top again
and anger it did surge
but from this irish neighborhood
some heroes would emerge
enter now the children of tipperary hill
who changed the situation
with a most peculiar skill
the red lights on the bottom
and the green light's on the top
so youll think of dear old ireland
whenever you go or stop
this spectacle youll never see
on any other road
to tell you irelands shamrock
is above old englands rose
this tipp hill band of brothers
with stones all in their fists
would create a situation
where the red light wont exist
their aim was high and mighty
as the missiles met their mark
and left the green light safe
while the red light would go dark
jacko, mikis, stubbs, eugene,
george, the duke and richie
kenny, george and bounce
and to round it off was packy
they caused a big commotion
stone throwers one and all
and found a way in syracuse
to answer ireland's call
no sooner would the city
replace the lumination
when another stone would hit the mark
and change the situation
 the red lights on the bottom
the green light's on the top
so youll think of dear old ireland
whenever you go or stop
this spectacle youll never see
on any other road
to tell you irelands shamrock
is above old englands rose
the pelting was relentless
so the city changed it back
the green light was on top again
thanks to this irish pack
in 1987 the throwers all were made
grand marshals of the syracuse
st. patricks day parade
stone throwers all were recognized
for deeds they all had done
while warrants for arrest
were finally expunged
then peter coleman built a park
adjacent to this light
with a statue of the boys
who believed that they were right
so if you visit syracuse
and tipperary hill
youll find the green light on the top
is burning brightly still
thanks to shirley norquest whose father george cowburn was a 'stone thrower' shirley provided me with all the historical information thanks to brian hyland for helping shape the melody and the arrangement"
Streets of London,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=518,"have you seen the old man
in the closed-down market
kicking up the paper, with his worn out shoes?
in his eyes you see no pride
and held loosely at his side
yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news
so how can you tell me you're lonely,
and say for you that the sun don't shine?
let me take you by the hand
and lead you through the streets of london
i'll show you something
to make you change your mind
have you seen the old girl
who walks the streets of london
dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
she's no time for talking,
she just keeps right on walking
carrying her home in two carrier bags.
in the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven,
same old man is sitting there on his own
looking at the world
over the rim of his tea-cup,
each tea last an hour
then he wanders home alone
and have you seen the old man
outside the seaman's mission
memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears.
in our winter city, the rain cries a little pity
for one more forgotten hero
and a world that doesn't care"
Streets of New York,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=346,"i was eighteen years old when i went down to dublin
with a fist full of money and a carload of dreams
""take your time"" said me father, ""stop rushin' like hell,
and remember the world's not what it seems to be""
""for there are fellows that will cut you for the coat on your back,
or the watch that you've got from your mother""
""so take care me young bucko and mind yourself well,
would you give this wee note to my brother?""
at the time uncle benjy was a policeman in brooklyn
my father the youngest looked after the farm
then a phone call from amerikay said, ""send the lad over!""
the old fellow said, ""sure it wouldn't do any harm.""
""for i spent my life working this dirty old ground
for a few pints of porter and the smell of a pound.
sure then maybe there's somethin' you'll learn or you'll see
you can bring it on home to make it easy on me.""
so i landed at kennedy and a big yellow taxi
took me and my bags through the streets and the rain
my poor heart was thumpin' around with excitement
i hardly even heard wat the driver was sayin'
we came in the shore parkway through the flatlands of brooklyn
to my uncle's apartment on east fifty third
i was feeling so happy i was hummin' a song
and i sang ""you're as free as a bird""
but the short of the story what i found out that day
was that benjy was shot down in an uptown farray
and while i was flyin' my way to new york
poor benjy was lyin' in a cold city morgue
i phoned up the old fellow and i told him the news
i could tell he could hardly stand up in his shoes
and i wept when he told me, ""go ahead with the plan,
and not to forget, be a proud irish man.""
so i went up to nelly's beside fordam road
and i started to learn about liftin' a load
but the heaviest thing that i carried that year
were the bittersweet thoughts of my hometown so dear
i went back that december 'cause the old fellow died
had to borrow the money from phil on the side
and all the bright flowers and brass couldn't hide
the poor wasted face of my father
i sold off the old farmyard for what it was worth
and into my bag stuck a handful of earth
then i boarded a train and i caught me a plane
and i found myself back in the us again
its been twenty two years since i set foor in dublin
my kids know to use the correct knife and fork
still i'll never forget her green grass and her rivers
as i keep law and order in the streets of new york"
Sweet Carnlough Bay,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=347,"when winter was brawling, o'er high hills and mountains
and dark were the clouds o'er the deep rolling sea,
i spied a wee lass as the daylight was dawning
she was asking the road to sweet carnlough bay.
i said,""my fair lass, i surely will tell ye
the number of miles or how far it might be
but if you'll consent i'll convoy you a wee bit
and i'll show you the road to sweet carnlough bay.
you turn to the right and pass down by the churchyard
cross over the river and down by the sea;
we'll call in pat hamill's and have a wee drop there
just to help us along to sweet carnlough bay.
here's a health to pat hamill likewise the dear lassie
and to every laddie that's listening to me
and ne'er turn your back on a bonnie young lassie
when she's asking the road to sweet carnlough bay."
Sweet Quarantine ,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=587,"to the tune of sweet caroline
where it began (china)
i cant begin to knowin
how this has spread throughout the world
started in spring
probably right into summer
whod have believed id be alone
hands...washing hands
touching soap
dont touch me, i wont touch you
sweet quarantine ....blah blah blah
having tp feels so good
ive been inside
just go out to buy some food
but now i:
look at the night here in this lonely curfew
theres not a soul past 10 pm
and when i sneeze
into my arm and shoulder
i wont dare cough when next to you
one, touching no one
reaching out stay the hell away from me!
where it began
hoarding the toilet paper
i can just hold it for so long
sanitize gel
seems that you grabbed that up too
what you are doing is so wrong
hands...washing hands
touching soap
dont touch me, i wont touch you

trying to stream
everyones on my wifi

Syracuse is a Crazy Mixed up Town,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=568," 1
syracuse new york me boys
is a crazy mixed up town
where people still eat dinosaur
and the stop light's upside down
it's the home of air conditioning
for reasons quite unclear
'cause it wins the golden snowball trophy
almost every year
way back before the settlers came to onondaga lake
folks swam and fished it's waters
which now's a big mistake
then clinton built the erie canal across the empire state
and syracuse that son of a ditch sealed onondaga's fate
 1
the irish built the erie canal and settled syracuse
got thirsty in it's saltworks or at least that's their excuse
they moved to tipperary hill on syracuse west side
and they cursed the bloody orangemen up until the day they died
 1
now according to some rumors and reliable reports
the irish love their boozin' and the irish love their sports
they pack the city's bars to cheer on boeheim's latest boys
cause basketball's a sport that every irishman enjoy
 1
and when in march the madness spreads
around all syracuse the talk will turn to jerry mac
when folk get in the juice
they'll measure every player against carmello and hakeem
and dress themselves from head to foot in orange just like their team
 1
so if you go to syracuse around st. patrick's day
where all the people dress in orange to watch the orangeman play
don't think that any irishman has got his colors wrong
just raise your glass of guinness and sing my little song
 2
syracuse new york me boys
is a crazy mixed up town
where all the irish dress in orange
and the stop light's upside down

Technology,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=550,"sittin on a wednesday on a rainy afternoon
there isnt much to do today so i guess ill write a tune
imagine feeling boredom in this day and age
to have all this technology staring in my face
if you want your hours to speed away than youtube is best
so many ways for idiots to get things off their chest
the minutes quickly adding up with the next link they provide
the reward is failing eyesight and sores on my behind
technology you move so fast
is verbal conversation
something of the past?
if its here today you know it just wont last
ive a thousand friends on facebook and some i know by name
how about a short experiment to test these valued friends
ill set up a pay pal secured account and ask for a $10 dollar gift
come tomorrow i will see just how many buddies i have left.
folks my age remember playing albums i suppose
rushing home with new releases and listening with eyes closed
but today the music industry will tell you what to know
you just cant have a song today without a video
i love to play in restaurants where social people roam
no time to read a menu while im checking on my phone
one night a silent couple perhaps was feeling hurt
then he texts his love a question, do you want dessert
written letters and newspapers, maps and greeting cards
are falling by the wayside as society falls hard
we date on line, and recreate send e-cards to celebrate
next thing theyll have is an app to help the young folks procreate"

she's got a comment full of love
and sometimes when the game is on the line

they found their seats had all been sold
mcgreevey led the charge into the park
stormed the gates and put the game on hold
the rooters gave the other team a dreadful fright

up from 'third base' to huntington

The Bonnie Lass of Fyvie-O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=517,"there once was a troop of irish dragoons,
came marching down through fyvie-o
the captain fell in love with a rare bonny lass,
her name it was called pretty peggy-o.
and it's come down the stairs pretty peggy, my dear
oh come down the stairs pretty peggy-0 oh
come down the stair, comb back your yellow hair
bid a long farewell to your mammy-o.
i never did intend a soldier's wife for to be,
i never will marry a soldier-o,
i never did intend to go to a foreign land.
a soldier will never enjoy me, 0.
there's many a bonny jean in the town of aberdeen
there's many a bonny lass in the garioch
there's many a bonny lass in the howe o auchterless
but the flower o' them all bides in fyvie-o
now the captain he cried 'mount!
mount, boys, mount!'
the colonel he cried 'tarry, 0!'
'we'll tarry for a while, for another day or twa,
to see if this bonny lass will marry, o!'
but long ere we reached the howe o' auchterless,
we had our captain to carry o.
and long ere we reached the streets of aberdeen
we had our captain to bury o.
now green grow the buds by the bonny ythanside
and low lie the lowlands o fyvie-o
the captain's name was ned, he died for the maid
he died for the chambermaid of fife-0.
fyvie, the garioch, and the howe of auchterless are all places in that region. thank you sean damer for the following:
there once was a troop o' irish dragoons
cam marching doon through fyvie-o
and the captain's fa'en in love wi' a very bonnie lass
and her name it was ca'd pretty peggy-o
there's many a bonnie lass in the howe o auchterless
there's many a bonnie lass in the garioch
there's many a bonnie jean in the streets of aiberdeen
but the floower o' them aw lies in fyvie-o
o come doon the stairs, pretty peggy, my dear
come doon the stairs, pretty peggy-o
come doon the stairs, comb back your yellow hair
bid a last farewell to your mammy-o
it's braw, aye it's braw, a captain's lady for to be
and it's braw to be a captain's lady-o
it's braw to ride around and to follow the camp
and to ride when your captain he is ready-o
o i'll give you ribbons, love, and i'll give you rings
i'll give you a necklace of amber-o
i'll give you a silken petticoat with flounces to the knee
if you'll convey me doon to your chamber-o
what would your mother think if she heard the guineas clink
and saw the haut-boys marching all before you o
o little would she think gin she heard the guineas clink
if i followed a soldier laddie-o
i never did intend a soldier's lady for to be
a soldier shall never enjoy me-o
i never did intend to gae tae a foreign land
and i never will marry a soldier-o
i'll drink nae more o your claret wine
i'll drink nae more o your glasses-o
tomorrow is the day when we maun ride away
so farewell tae your fyvie lasses-o
the colonel he cried, mount, boys, mount, boys, mount
the captain, he cried, tarry-o
o tarry yet a while, just another day or twa
til i see if the bonnie lass will marry-o"
The Dear Little Shamrock,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=431,"the dear little shamrock
( there's a dear little plant that grows in our isle,
'twas saint patrick himself sure that set it;
and the sun on his labour with pleasure did smile,
and with dew from his eye often wet it.
it shines thro' the bog thro' the brake, thro' the mireland,
and he call'd it the dear little shamrock of ireland.
: the dear little shamrock, the sweet little shamrock,
the dear little, sweet little shamrock of ireland.
that dear little plant still grows in our land,
fresh and fair as the daughters of erin,
whose smiles can bewitch, and whose eyes can command,
in each climate they ever appear in:
for they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland,
just like their own dear little shamrock of ireland.
that dear little plant that springs from our soil,
when its three little leaves are extended,
denotes from the stalk we together should toil,
and ourselves by ourselves be befriended.
and still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland,
from one root should branch, like the shamrock of ireland."
The Galway Ghost ,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=558,"my name is seamus ryan from a farm outside lochrae.
and i always intended to live there all my days.
but when i was young, just twenty one, in a drunken barroom fight,
i killed a man and away i ran; i was hunted day and night.
i sailed away, to amerikay, to the sidewalks of new york.
so far away from galway bay, from dublin and from cork....
and i can't go back, for love or craic, to my native land again.
i'm a yankee now, and that is how i'll stay 'til my life's end.
and now the name i gave myself to lead an exile's life.
and i never told another soul, and never took a wife.
i thumbed my way through the usa, i roamed from coast to coast.
so all alone, so far from home, i was called the galway ghost.
in amerikay, i went astray, and battled men and law.
with gun and knife, i carved my life, it was my tragic flaw.
in albany i tried to flee, the warden's on my trail.
but they captured me, they shackled me, they entombed me in this jail.
when i was young and on the run, from the life i left behind,
i'd rather drink than think the thoughts, that now prey on my mind,
of the galway sky and days gone by and the girl who loves me most,
so raise your glass to the haunted past of seamus ryan's ghost.

The Green Fields of Gweedore,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=496,"the green fields of gaoth dobhair appears on clannad's album 'fuaim'
down past dunlewey's bonny lakes one morning i did stray
until i reached sweet clady banks where the silvery salmon play
i strolled around through old bunbeg and down along the shore
and gazed with admiration on the green fields of gweedore
i visit magherclocher on middletown heights
i stand beneath me lies the ocean wide and machergallon strand
those sandy banks so dear to me, those banks i do adore
behind me lies sweet derrybeg and the green fields of gweedore
the bonny isle of gola and inishmean so near
i see the little fishing fleet as it lies along the pier
i wander through the graveyard where those have gone before
that once lived happy and content by the green fields of gweedore
i see sweet inish oirthir and far off tory isle
i view the ocean liners as they steam along in style
on board are irish emigrants with hearts both sad and sore
as they gazed on old tir chonaill hills
and the green fields of gweedore

The Guinness Widget,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=552,"had a tough work week,
so time to take a sneak,
kick back in an easy chair.
feel like havin' a fling,
open your doo-hicky thing,
that little somethin' should be poppin' up there.
you're hearin' in your head,
somethin' your momma said,
""doncha' fidget with your widget,
doncha' dare!""
gee, you're all in a flutter,
get your mind out of the gutter,
i was talkin' 'bout guinness beer
had quite a night last night,
woke up feelin' right
and wishin' for some more of the same.
put your big strong hand
around that nice firm can
and you knew that you'd be back in the game.
you're hearin' in your head,
somethin' your momma said,
""don't put a digit on your widget,
doncha' dare!""
well, you're all in a flutter,
get your mind out of the gutter,
i was talkin' 'bout guinness beer!
bridge:
no need to be in a pub
to get the genuine sup
in a city or out of town
think of the excitement
to anticipate delightment
as that cascades going up and down
please dont think im crass
when you release that gas
you know its surely worth the wait
you bet your bottom dollar
youll have a perfect priests collar
in a minute and fifty eight
sometimes you just cant stop
and then you pop the top
to get the color ruby red
down your neck will dip
with a stiff upper lip
to get mustache from that creamy head
when your package releases
the joy inside increases
im gunna fidget with my widget yes i dare!
gee, you're all in a flutter,
get your mind out of the gutter,
i was talkin' 'bout guinness beer!"
The Humor is on Me Now,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=483,"oh, as i went out one mornin' it bein' the month of may
a farmer and his daughter i spied upon me way.
and the girl sat down quite calmly
to the milkin' of her cow,
sayin' i will and i must get married for the humor is on me now.
oh, the humor is on me now.
oh, the humor is on me now.
sayin' i will and i must get married for the humor is on me now.
so at last the daughter married
she married well to do
and loved her darlin' husband
for a month, a year or two.
but sean was all a tyrant,
and she quickly rued her vow,
sayin' i'm sorry i ever got married for the humor is off me now.
oh, the humor is off me now.
oh, the humor is off me now.
sayin' i'm sorry i ever got married for the humor is off me now."
The Next Step,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=487,"this is the song i submitted to american idol for their song writing competition:
youve made it this far

and find out where youre going
the next step is the hardest of them all
reaching for the stars
youll find out who you are whats inside you?
and whats your driving force
life had tried you
to get you on this course your wildest dreams are tapped

focused on horizons
and lost friends along the way.

for all the world to see
just look within your heart your destiny is calling

so just prepare yourself when that minute comes your way
the years of sacrifice have brought this time to me

and bring friends along the way.
so now its time to say

The Old Refrain,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=491,"i often think of home dee-ol-ee-ay
when i am all alone and far away;
i sing an old refrain, dee-ol-ee-ay
for it recalls to me a bygone day
it takes me back again to meadows fair
where sunlight's golden rays beam everywhere
my childhood joys again come back to me
my mother's face in fancy too
i see it was my mother taught me how to sing
and to that memory my heart will cling
i'm never sad and alone while on my way
as long as i can sing dee-ol-ee-ay
though years have passed and gone, dee-ol-ee-ay
and though my heart is young my head is grey.
yet still the echoes ring, dee-ol-ee-ay
and dear old memories forever stay.
this song will bring me visions full of light
and sweetest dreams throughout the darkest night
of all that life can give, that song is best
i'll take it with me when i go to rest
and when at last my journey here is o'er
'twill ring more joyfully than e'er before
for up to heavens i will take my lay
the angels, too, will sing dee-ol-ee-ay"
The TP Song (Hoarders),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=583,"you feel your lifes in danger
and now you need to hoard
you watch the cable news
to get the latest word
you must protect your family
so you become insane
throw logic out the window
while you use your lizard brain
you think about the hardships of the past
and wonder how long supplies will
last
but be rest assured , youre skillful at the hoard
that youll leave this world with the cleanest ass.
what makes you think that you can just relax
while youre stocking up with those family packs
im wondering if covid is your greatest fear
or youre planning that youll die from diarrhea
there are others who are not the hoarding sort
who fear a full 14 days of the hershey squirts
its not paper that they save
but a sparking butt they crave
while installing porcelain bidets
its your fellow man youre harming
while you stockpile all the charmin
your priorities are slightly out of whack
youre not showing too much class
hoarding hospital masks
and preoccupied with cleaning out your crack."
The Valley Where Wishes Come True,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=579,"the valley where wishes come true
fairy pipers are calling, mucushla
where the moonlight is silver and blue
and so sweet is the sound of their music
in the valley where wishes come true
over hillside and rivers i hear them
all their spells they are weaving anew
and the heart of me aches to be with you
in the valley where wishes come true
can you hear their sweet message macushla
how the west wind is sighing for you
and the leaves whisper low of our wooing
in the valley where wishes come true
theres a little white cabin enchanted
with the starlight and dreams drifting through
and its there i will find you and love you
in the valley where wishes come true"
There Were Roses,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=547,"so my song for you this evening,
it's not to make you sad
not for adding to the sorrows
of this troubled northern land
but lately i've been thinking
and it just won't leave my mind
to tell you of two friends one time
they were both good friends of mine
alan bell from banagh,
he lived just across the fields
a great man for the music,
and the dancing and the reels
o'malley came from south armagh
to court young alice fair
and we often meet on the ryan road
and laughter filled the air
--
there were roses, roses
there were roses
and the tears of the people ran together
though alan he was protestant
and sean was catholic born
it never made a difference,
for the friendship it was strong
and sometimes in the evening
when we heard the sound of drums
we said it won't divide us,
we will always be the one
for the ground our fathers plowed in,
the soil it is the same
and the places where we say our prayers
have just got different names
we talked about the friends who'd died
and we hoped there'd be no more
it's little then we realized the tragedy in store
--
it was on a sunday morning
when the awful news came round
another killing has been done
just outside newry town
we knew that alan danced up there,
we knew he liked the band
but when we heard that he was dead
we just could not understand
we gathered at the graveside
on that cold and rainy day
and the minister he closed his eyes
and he prayed for no revenge
and all the ones who knew him
from along the ryan road
then bowed our heads and said a prayer
for the resting of his soul
--
well fear it filled the countryside
there was fear in every home
when the car of death came
prowling round the lonely ryan road
a catholic would be killed tonight
to even up the score
oh christ it's young o'malley
that they've taken from the door
alan was my friend! he cried,
he begged them with his fear
but centuries of hatred
have ears that can not hear
an eye for an eye, was all that filled their minds
and another eye for another eye
till everyone is blind
--
so my song for you this evening,
it's not to make you sad
not for adding to the sorrows
of this troubled northern land
but lately i've been thinking
and it just won't leave my mind
to tell you of two friends one time
they were both good friends of mine
i don't know where the moral is
or where this song should end
but i wonder just how many wars
are fought between good friends
and those who give the orders
are not the ones to die
it's bell and o'malley
and the likes of you and i
there were roses, roses
there were roses
and the tears of a people ran together
there were roses, roses
there were roses...."
These are My Mountains,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=352,"for fame and for fortune i wandered the earth
and now i've come back to the land of my birth
i've brought back my treasures but only to find
they're less than the pleasures i first left behind
for these are my mountains and this is my glen
the braes of my childhood will know me again
no land's ever claimed me tho' far i did roam
for these are my mountains and i'm going home
and i'm coming home
the berm by the road sings at my going by
the lark overhead wings a welcoming cry
the loch where the scart flies at last i can see
it's here where my heart lies it's here i'll be free
kind faces will meet me and welcome me in
and how they will greet me my ain kith and kin
the night by the ingle old sangs will be sung
at last i'll be hearing my ain mother tongue."
This is My Homeland (My Donegal),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=353,"the lights of london are far behind
my thoughts of homeland are crowding my mind
familiar places come into view
i see my home now, soon i'll see you
this is my homeland, the place i was born in
no matter where i go, it's in my soul
my feet may wander a thousand places
but my heart will lead me back home to my donegal
we'll talk to the old folks sure they're getting on
put them to late nights and sing a few songs
we'll talk of the neighbors and life on the town
there's so much to tell them, of the days that are gone
and then tomorrow, we'll take a walk
down by st. mary's to a sheltered spot
we'll kneel and pray there for the ones that are gone
and hope they'll remember their wandering son"
Through the Eyes of an Irishman,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=354,"when i was a boy 'round about three
i remember my grandfather sayin' to me
he said, ""learn to appreciate all that you see
for one day it'll mean so much more to you""
well without realizing the words he did say
sure it started me seein' things a different way
just like the colours of the sun goin' down in the bay
it was a sight i'll never forget
and we'll all meet tonight every child woman and man
for we know in our heart that we'll always be part
of a proud and wonderful land
yes we'll all meet tonight and we'll sing as loud as we can
of an island so green
that can only be seen through the eyes of an irishman
oh the days of my youth i spent searching around
and i couldn't believe all the beauty i found
just like the flowers and trees growing up from the ground
full of colour and so full of life
well at twenty four years that's when i started to roam
but it didn't take much to remind me of home
and i think of all the places and people i've known
that i may never see again"
Time Gentlemen Time,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=355,"here's to our friends
our steady old friends
the friends that are tried and true
they are the best
to hell with the rest
there's only one test that'll do
and it's time gentlemen time
and here's to our youth
the days of our youth
how slowly they fade away
why should we wait
until it's too late
let's kick up your heels today
and it's time gentlemen time
here's to the girls
the lovely young girls
the girls that we used to know
here's to their lips
their slender little hips
what was it made them grow?
and it's time gentlemen time
this song was given to me by sean at pickle bill's in cleveland. jerry powell, pickle's creator said it was a favorite of liam clancy's to finish an evening of music."
Tipperary Christening,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=356,"it was down in that place tipperary

when home from the church they came
with father tom and big mickey brannigan
scores of as purity
boys and girls as you'd ever  see
when baby set up such a squalling

""patte de foi gras"" whatever that means
made out of goose livers and grease
red headed ducks with salmon and peas
bandy legged frogs and peruvian ostriches
bottle nose pickerel woodcock and snipe
and everything else that would please
after dinner of course we had spaking
there was handshaking there was leave taking
in the corner old mothers matchmaking
with other innocent sins
and we drank a good health to each other
then to each brother then to each mother
but the last toast i thought i would smother
when they hoped that the next would be twins"

oft' in dreams i wander to that cot again
i hear her softly hummin' to me as when she did back then

when she used to rock me fast asleep outside that cabin door  "
Town I Loved So Well,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=359,"in my memory i will always see the town that i have loved so well
where our school played ball by the gas yard wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell.
going home in the rain running up the dark lane
past the jail and down beside the fountain
those were happy days in so many many ways
in the town i loved so well.
in the early morn the shirt factory horn
called the women from creggan, the moor and the bog
while the men on the dole played a mother's role
fed the children and then walked the dog
and when times got rough there was just about enough
but they saw it through without complaining
for deep inside was a burning pride
in the town i loved so well.
there was music there in the derry air
like a language that we could all understand
i remember the day when i earned my first pay
when i played in a small pick-up band
there i spent my youth and to tell you the truth
i was sad to leave it all behind me
there i learned about life and i found a wife
in the town i loved so well:
but when i returned oh my eyes how they burned
to see how a town could be brought to its knees
by the armoured cars and the bombed out bars
and the gas that hangs on to every breeze
now the army's installed by the old gasyard wall
and the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
with their tanks and their guns
oh my god, what have they done
to the town i loved so well.
now the music's gone but they carry on
for their spirit's been bruised, never broken
they will not forget but their hearts are set
on tomorrow and peace once again
now what's done is done and what's won is won
and what's lost is lost and gone forever
i can only pray for a bright brand new day
for the town i iove so well."
Transit Van,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=461,"margaret thatcher when she says to me
there'd be no unemployment if
you'd all use a bit of initiative
i was on the dole i was broke and bored
says i i'll take her at her word
got a lone from the credit union man
and i bought myself a transit van
the next step up the ladder now
i bought myself an old fat sow
i crossed over the border quite legally
and collected the common market subsidy
signed all the forms handed back the pen
then smuggled me pig back home again
ten times a day we'd work this plan
myself the sow and the transit van
of travel sickness the old sow died
so i thought it was time i diversified
i took all the money from the biscuit tin
filled the van to the roof with whiskey and gin
around the south my wares i'd sell in public houses and hotels
there was never a guard nor a customs man
got his nose inside that transit van
at festivals and fleadhs and fairs
if the craic was good you would find me there
at all big matches in croke park
and i've danced with springsteen in the dark
i fought with tinkers in ballinasloe
i've danced in the streets around listowel
mothers had their daughters warned
stay well away from that transit van
but it being lent and the drink trade slow
i took to carrying videos
while on the road to ballybay
found a customs roadblock in me way
to face the border i got her turned
the engine roared and the tires burned
there were five patrol cars fully manned
in hot pursuit of the transit van
through clontbruit i did run
as quick as peter robinson
going round the corner i hit a dog
went over the hedge into galla bog
well i sat on the bank and watched all i owned
sinking in the bog hole like a stone
she was lying on her roof and the wheels still turning
and the stereo was playing ''farewell to erin''
so now i'm back where i first began
no job no money but i have a plan
there's a wee girl down in tullysarn
she could hold my future in her hand
now she doesn't look like a film star
but she's been telling me about her da!
he owns no property or land
but he has two sows and a transit van
the queen of england drives a rolls royce car
her son charlie drives a jag-u-ar
but when the pope came to i-re-land
he drove around in a transit van.
i received a message that this song was written by: sean mone of keady, armagh according to:martin patrick ryan"

Two Hundred Year Old Alcoholic,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=474,"when i was eighty i started smoking
took to drinking at eighty-five
at ninety i started courting
thank god that i was alive
ninety-five saw me in business
determined to rake in a pile
at a hundred i made my first million
and i started living in style
 oh, it's never too late to start living
to get out and have some fun
the sun will be just as shiny in the morning
as the first day the world begun
well i moved to an uptown penthouse
used fifties to light my cigars
developed a taste for fine champagne
drove fast i-talian cars
but the doctor he give me a warning
and a lecture on right and wrong
if i didn't give up my sinful ways
i couldn't live very long
but i said to him...
now i'm a two-hundred year old alcoholic
and the nicotine's caught up on me
but worst of all in this morning's mail
got a suit for paternity
but i'm not really unhappy
'cause maybe i'll have me a son
and his morning's will be just as shiny
as the first day the world begun"
Unicorn (Green Alligators),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=361,"a long time ago, when the earth was green
there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
they'd run around free while the earth was being born
and the loveliest of all was the unicorn
there was green alligators and long-necked geese
some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
the loveliest of all was the unicorn
the lord seen some sinning and it gave him pain
and he says, ""stand back, i'm going to make it rain""
he says, ""hey noah, i'll tell you what to do
build me a floating zoo,
and take some of those
green alligators and long-necked geese
some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
don't you forget my unicorns
old noah was there to answer the call
he finished up making the ark just as the rain started to fall
he marched the animals two by two
and he called out as they came through
hey lord,
i've got green alligators and long-necked geese
some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
some cats and rats and elephants, but lord, i'm so forlorn
i just can't find no unicorns""
and noah looked out through the driving rain
them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
kicking and splashing while the rain was falling
oh, them silly unicorns
there was green alligators and long-necked geese
some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
noah cried, ""close the door because the rain is falling
and we just can't wait for no unicorns""
the ark started moving, it drifted with the tide
the unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
and the waters came down and sort of floated them away
that's why you never see unicorns to this very day
you'll see green alligators and long-necked geese
some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
you're never gonna see no unicorns"
Up! Up! Newmarket,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=492,"in the lovely island wood
where with pride we often stood
gazing on the scenic beauty all around.
and its rambling up smarten,
barleyhill and meens between,
oh! what pleasure and content
there we found.
up! up! newmarket say the exiles,
up! up! newmart say they all.
whether we shall here remain
or return home again,
may newmarket ever rise
and never fall. note: i guess you know my mother's side , the walshs, come from new market. i received this in a christmas card of course, from new market. love mom"
Valley of Knockanure,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=362,"you may sing or speak about easter week or the heroes of ninety-eight
those fenian men who roamed the glen for vict'ry or defeat
their names on history's page are told, their memories will endure
not a song was sung about three young men in the valley of knockanure.
there was lyons and walsh and the dalton boy, they were young and in their prime
they rambled to a lonely spot where the black and tans did hide
the republic bold they did uphold, tho' outlawed on the moor
and side by side they fought and died in the valley of knockanure.
it was on a neighbouring hillside we listened in hushed dismay
in every house, in every town a young girl knelt to pray
they're closing in around them now with rifle fire so sure
and lyons is dead and young dalton's down in the valley of knockanure.
but e'er the guns could seal his fate, young walsh had broken thro'
with a prayer to god he spurned the sod as against the hill he
the bullets tore his flesh in two yet he cried with voice so sure,
""revenge i'i1 get for my comrade's death in the valley of knockanure.""
the summer sun is sinking low behind the field and lea
the pale moon light is shining bright far off beyond tralee
the dismal stars and the clouds afar are darkening o'er the moor
and the banshee cried when young dalton died in the valley of knockanure"
Vodka For Jesus,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=581,"lent it is a solemn time for prayer and sacrifice
to give up something that you love or maybe it's a vice
maybe you will do a deed in service to the lord
and hope like all good catholics you won't perish by the sword
(that's why)
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
i'll avoid what's from the tap to keep the devil off my back
i'll testify there is no power higher
when i chose a different flavor it was for my lord and savior
to shun guinness and instead pour stolichnaya
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
your first miracle divine was turning water into wine
in every earthen jar or glass or bottle
but i'm turing beer into vodka cause i could never top ya
i'm doing what i can as a mere mortal
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
when god hears what i've done to revere the holy one
to achieve a spiritual high with vodka seven
well the pearly gates will swing, st. pete will say,""straight in!""
while the angels raise a toast to me in heaven
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
i heard hell's the place that stinks so i'm sticking with well drinks
for 40 days my plan i'll not refute.
but st. patrick's on a monday and to ensure it is a fun day
i'll use my sunday lenten substitute
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
if it's chocolate you deny or any cake or pie
or any fine dessert that's on the list
well my reward will be superb cause i kicked beer to the curb
while i'm suffering with grey goose and a twist.
i'm drinking vodka for jesus (for jesus)
the son of god the christ
i'm drinking vodka for jesus
and that is my lenten sacrifice
ah men!"
Voyage,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=363,"i am a sailor
you're my first mate
we signed on together
we coupled our fate
hauled up our anchor
determined not to fail
for the heart's treasure
together we set sail.
with no maps to guide us
we steered our own course
we rode out the storms
when the winds were gale force
sat out the doldrums
in patience and hope
working together
we learned how to cope
life is an ocean
love is a boat
in troubled waters
keeps us afloat
when we started this voyage
there was just me and you
now gathered round us
we have our own crew
together we're in this relationship
we built it with care
and to last the whole trip
our true destination's
not marked on any chart
we're navigating
for shores of the heart"
Walk in the Irish Rain,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=364,"when the sun goes down o'er dublin town

a gentle mist all heaven kissed
like teardrops off an angel's wing
don't you know you'll cleanse your soul
with a walk in the irish rain.
oh katherine take my hand
i've got three pounds and change
and i'll sing you songs of love again
and when i get too drunk to sing...
we'll walk in the irish rain
forever more i've stepped ashore
my sailing days are over, oh
through time and tide and by your side
together we'll grow old.
i threw my sea bag in the bin
and brought these pretty flowers home
kiss me kate, we'll celebrate
before the bloom is gone 
a tinker and a tailor and a drunken old sailor
they all get together and they start to play
time stands still while they sing their fill
oh shout till the break of day.
a sweet little lady with a glass of stout
sippin' it down 'til the foam runs out
she'll help her old man home again
with a walk in the irish rain "

We Want No irish Here,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=475,"our ship it docked in new york town
and we took our bags ashore
this was the land of the free they said
we'd see hard times no more
but when we looked for work next day
wherever we'd appear
the boss so proud, would shout out loud
'we want no irish here'
we have loyal hearts and willing hands
of work we have no fear
but when we'd ask for a job they'd say
'we want no irish here'
we traveled 'round from town to town
we traveled south and north
we tried our best to get a job
so we could prove our worth
but everywhere, it was the same
we searched both far and near
we'd get in line, then see the sign
'we want no irish here'
but prejudice soon fades away
when you find a heart that's true
and all we needed was the chance
to prove what we could do
we fought in wars and drove street cars
built railroads far and near
were cops, wrote news, paid our unioun dues
now the irish are welcome here
we have loyal hearts and willing hands
of work we have no fear
if you're out for fun or a job well done
you'll find the irish here"

Wearin,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=367,"""oh paddy dear and did you hear
the news that's going 'round?
the shamrock is forbid by law
to grow on irish ground
no more st. patrick's day to keep
his colours can't be seen
there is a cruel law against
the wearing of the green""
i met with napper tandy
and he shook me by the hand
and he said, ""how's dear old ireland
and how does she stand?""
""she's the most distressful country
that you have ever seen
they're hangin' men and women there
for wearing of the green""
then if the colour we must wear
is england's cruel red
let it remind us of the blood
that ireland has shed
so take the shamrock from your hat
and throw it to the sod
and never fear will take root there
tho under foot it's trod
when the law can stop the blades of grass
from growing as they grow
and when the leaves of summertime
their verdure dare not show
well it's then i'll change the colour
that i wear in my corbeen
but till that time praise god i'll keep
to wearing of the green"
Weatherman,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=478,"they finally pissed me off enough to write a song about how they are not only wrong...they'll tell you to change your plans just so you can stay home and watch their sorry asses on tv.
who can make a forecast with everything high tech
deliver it with confidence and still be incorrect?
the weatherman, the weatherman can
the weatherman can 'cause he mixes it with bullshit
just so he will look good.
he predicts it's warm and sunny
for your nice outdoor event
don't listen what he tells you
go ahead and rent a tent
the weatherman, the weatherman can
the weatherman can 'cause he mixes it with bullshit
just so he will look good.
the weatherman sells everything he says
hoping he will find a buyer
whose opinion can be higher
than a paid professional liar?
today it's warm and sunny
""hey! why you wearing winter boots?""
i'd need to move to san diego
for a chance to hear the truth
the weatherman, the weatherman can
the weatherman can
'cause he mixes it with bullshit
just so he will look good.
the weatherman bets everyone forgets
hoping memories just won't last
never will be taken to task
for the accuracy of 5 day forecasts
i only make my living
when people leave the house
he'll tell you to stay home
and get his updates from your couch
the weatherman, the weatherman can
the weatherman can
'cause he mixes it with bullshit
just so he will look good."

West's Awake (The),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=370,"when all beside a vigil keep

mid rocks their guardian chivalry sing
oh let man learn liberty
from crashing winds and lashing sea
that chainess wave and lovely land
freedom and nationhood demand
be sure the great god never planned
for slumbering slaves a home so grand
and long a brave and haughty race
honored and sentinelled the place
sing oh, not even their son's disgrace
can quite destroy their glory's trace
for often in o'connor's van
to triumph dashed each connacht clan
and fleet as deer the normans ran
through corrsliabh pass and ardrahan
and later times saw deeds as brave
and glory guards clanricard's grave

at aughrim's slopes and shannon's waves
and if, when all a vigil keep

When I Dream O,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=372,"when i dream, i dream of you
when you dream, are you dreaming of me?
when you are beside me
you light all the fires
of the hopes and the memories you bring
when we are together
i wonder what i can give to you
after all you have given to me
one touch of your hand
can lead me to places
that i've never been
as long as we go there together
dreams can fade away
dreams can fade away
bridge
and all of the questions
that i have inside
how can it be you make me feel alive?
of all of the people that i've ever met
you are the only one
who makes me dream
makes me dream
if you could be music
the song you would sing
and all of the beauty
and joy you would bring
the world would stop turning
to hear the refrain
and the peace and the harmony
you bring, when we are together
dreams can fade away
dreams can fade away
the words have yet to fill the air
no song exists that could ever compare
to the dream that you are
i can keep you inside
till the dream fades away
and that only means...we're together
together again
the dream fades away
but that only means we're together
together again
the dream fades away
and that only means we're together"
When Irish Eyes are Smiling,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=373,"when irish eyes are smiling sure it's like a morn in spring
in the lilt of irish laughter you can hear the angels sing
when irish hearts are happy all the world seems bright and gay
but when irish eyes are smiling sure they'll steal your heart away
there's a tear in your eye and i'm wondering why
that it ever should be there at all
with such power in your smile sure a stone you'd beguile
and there's never a teardrop should fall
when your sweet lilting laughter's like some fairy song
and your eyes sparkle bright as can be
oh then laugh all the while and all other times smile
and then smile a smile for me  
for your smile is a part of the love in your heart,
and it makes even sunshine more bright.
like the linnet's sweet song, crooning all the day long,
comes your laughter and light for the springtime of life
is the sweetest of all
there is ne'er a real care or regret; ad while springtime is ours
throughout all of youth's hours, let us smile each chance we get."
When New York was Irish,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=374,"words and music by terence winch
copyright 1987 green linnet music
i'll sing you a song of days long ago
when the people from galway and the county mayo
and all over ireland came over to stay
and take up a new life in americay
they were ever so happy, they were ever so sad
to grow old in a new world through good times and bad
all the parties and weddings, the ceilis and wakes
when new york was irish, full of joys and heartbreaks
we worked on the subways, we ran the saloons
we built all the bridges, we played all the tunes
we put out the fires and controlled city hall
we started with nothing and wound up with it all  
you could travel from kingsbridge to queens or mid town
from highbridge to bay ridge,
from up town to down
from the east side to the seaside's
sweet summer scenes
we made new york city our island of dreams  
i look at the photos now
brittle with time
of the people i cherished when
the city was mine
o, how i loved all those radiant smiles
how i long for the days when we danced in the aisles

When Peggy O'Dea Came to Mullenalee ,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=428,"there is a sweet little village called mullenalee
and it lies just half way between cork and the sea
where the boys and the girls are all happy and free
contented and peaceful in mullenalee
but sure such an eden was not meant to be
and trouble decended on mullenalee
and it came of a sudden
like mist from the sea
when peggy o'dea came to mullenalee
she had left as a young girl aged about three
to sail with her parents far over the sea
and she learned some queer tricks in the far usa
and brough all there back to mullenalee
the queerest of clothes you ever did see
her lips and her nails painted red as could be
such clothes and such style sure you never did see
till peggy o'dea came to mullenalee
not a colleen was courted from cork to the sea
for the boys wanted no one but peggy o'dea
every one of them thought his wife she should be
till they found she had married old danny mcgee
he was bald as an egg and he'd turned 83
but he owned half the land around mullenalee
it was a very nice match and netween you and me
that's why peggy o'dea came to mullenalee
then the humor got around that miss peggy o'dea
wasn't all that she pretended to be
it appeared she had never been over the sea
but worked as a servent way back in tralee
the guards came nad took her right back to tralee
she was wearin her mistress's clothes so you see
and now everyone's happy except danny mcgee
since peggy o'dea is gone from mullenalee"

Where My Eileen is Waiting,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=482,"i am always light-hearted and easy,
not a care in the world have i,
for i know i am loved by a colleen
and i could not forget if i tried.
she lives far away o'er the mountain
where the little birds sing on the trees;
in a cottage all covered with ivy
my eileen is waiting for me.
it's over, it's over the mountain
where the little birds sing on the trees,
in a cottage all covered with ivy
my eileen is waiting for me.
the time i bade good-bye to eileen
is a time i will never forget
for the tears bubbled up from their slumbers
i fancy i see them yet;
they looked like the pearls in the ocean
as she wept her tale of love.
and she said 'my dear boy, don't forget me
till we meet here again or above."
Where the **** is Alice?,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=378,"sally called, she got the word,
she said i suppose you've heard . . . about alice.
well i ran to the window, and i looked out outside,
and i could hardly believe my eyes,
as a big limousine pulled slowly into alice's drive.
oh, i don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
i guess she's got her reasons but i just don't wanna know
'cause for twenty-four years i've been living next door to alice.
twenty-four years waiting for a chance,
to tell her how i feel, maybe get a second glance,
now i gotta get used to living next door to alice.
walk together, two kids in the park,
carved our initials deep in the bark . . . me and alice.
now she walks through the door with her head held high,
just for a moment i caught her eye,
as the big limousine pulled slowly out of alice's drive.
and sally called, and asked how i felt.
she said, i know how to help . . . get over alice.
she said, alice is gone, but i'm still here,
y'know i've been waiting for twenty-four years.
and the big limousine disappeared . . .
oh, i don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
i guess she's got her reasons but i just don't wanna know,
'cause for twenty-four years i've been living next door to alice.
twenty-four years, waiting for a chance,
to tell her how i feel and maybe get a second chance,
but i'll never get used to not living next door to alice."
Where the River Shannon Flows,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=379,"there's a pretty spot in ireland that i always claim for my land

to the girl i left behind me when we kissed and said goodbye
sure no letter i'll be mailing for soon will i be sailing
and i'll bless the ship that takes me to my dear old erin's shore
there i'll settle down forever i'll leave the old sod never
and i'll whisper to my sweetheart, ""come and take my name, for sure""
where dear old shannon's flowing
where the three leaved shamrock grows
where my heart is i am going to my little irish rose

Where the Three Counties Meet,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=380,"oh how lovely to be on the shores of lough rea
on a beautiful mid summer's morning
looking over the lake where the waters do break
by the hills in the county roscommon
oh i left from my home in the town of athlone
on the way to the three jolly pidgeons(?)
it was by glassen town on the road i sat down
and i looked o're the beautiful shannon
lough rea oh lough rea where the three counties meet
longford, west meath and roscommon
as i strolled 'round her banks be the heather and peat
they're the mem'ries i've never forgotten
oh sad was the day when i went far way
to work amongst timber and concrete
as i made me a plan for to follow life's span
i forsook the dear place of my homeland
if god grants me grace i'll return to the place
when the twilight of life has come o're me
as i stand on your shores like a bird my heart soars
as i gaze on the beauty around me"
Where's Your Johnny O?,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=377,"this song was written for my grandfather john o'shaughnessy. his youngest children were told he was dead.
they actually had him committed to a mental ward in highland falls, ny and his children and grandchildren never knew he was alive. when my mother's search for the family history discovered his whereabouts, he had just died the very day she found him.
i never got to meet the man.
the days of innocence
recalling many happy days
perhpas too young to recall
the times it rained
some reassuring words
could make your problems go away
the older,wiser ones
would know just what to say
they would comfort you in this time
your sense of longing
for a man you didn't know
but the truth they hoped
you would never find
where's your dad, your johnny o'?
the days of searching
to recall the history of a man
would yield no help
from the ones who knew him best
still 40 years would pass
while knowing ones still did their dance
while wearing proudly on their heart
his family crest
secret lies surround you
but with each stone you turn
your knowledge seems to grow
the tightest lips conceal
the truth from you
where's your dad your johnny o'?
you run and run and run
and still his voice will follow you
you should have known
there is endless time
you'll never, never find a place
where he can't follow you
i hope he haunts your memory now
like he's haunting mine
what was the circumstance
to ever make them hash a plan
to lock away the man
and forever lose the key?
and so elaborate was their plan
to rid john from their hands
they marked a gravesite
so their conscience could be free
secret lies surround you
but with each stone you turn
your knowledge seems to grow
the tightest lips conceal
the truth from you
where's your dad your johnny o'?
and then the day would come
while searching for the family lore
his name leaps off the page
and visions fill your mind
just 10 miles from your home
committed there in highland falls
but when you call you learn
you've just run out of time
we buried him this morning
such pain &amp; grief inside
you will never know
gone again without warning
you found your dad
your johnny o'?
you lived alone
you died alone"
Whiskey in the Jar,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=381,"it's as i was going over the cork and kerry mountains
i met with captain farrel and his money he was countin'
i first produced my pistol and i then produced my rapier
sayin', ""stand and deliver for i am your bold deceiver:
mush a ring a ma dor um dah (4 claps)
whack for the daddy oh (2 claps)
whack for the daddy oh
there's whiskey in the jar (yell ""hey"" with a simultaneous clap)
i counted up my money and it made a pretty penny
i took that money home and i gave it to my jenny
she promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
but the devil take the women for they never can be easy  
i went into my chamber for to take a little slumber
i dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder
but jenny took my charges and filled them up with water
and sent for captain farrel to be ready for the slaughter 
it was early in the mornin' before i rose to travel
surrounded by the footmen and likewise captain farrel
i went for my old pistol for they'd stolen my old rapier
but i couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner i was taken 
if anyone can save me it's my brother in the army
i think that he is stationed in cork or in killarney
and if he would be here we'd be rovin' in kilkenny
i know he'd treat be better than my darlin' sportin' jenny 
now some take delight in the fishin' and the fowlin'
others take delight in the carriage wheels a rollin
i takes delight in the juice of the barley
and countin' pretty women in the mornin' oh so early "

Whiskey on a Sunday,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=382,"come day go day, i wish in my heart it was sunday
drinkin' buttermilk through the week and whiskey on a sunday
he sits on the corner by ould beggar's bush atop of an ould packing crate
he's got three wooden dolls who can dance and can sing
and he sits with a smile on his face  
his tired ould hands tug away on the strings, the puppets they dance up and down
it's a far better show than you ever will see
in the fanciest theatre in town 
i'm sad to relate that ould sad davie died in nineteen hundred and four
his three wooden dolls in the dustbin are laid
their songs will be heard never more 
some dark stormy night should your passin' that way and the winds blowin' up from the sea you can still hear the voice of ould sad davie
as he sings to his dancin' dolls three  
hi donal,
this song is called ""the ballad of seth davey"" set on the river mersey.
right where do we start, a dancing doll is a manikin about 18 inches high
pivoted at the shoulders hip and knees. it is held by hand using a piece of
dowling about 18 inches long is drilled into it's back. the perfomer half
sits on a thin plank of wood 4 inches by 24 and places the doll on the
flexible end. he then drums the plank in time to the song he sings. this
causes he doll to jiggle upand down and the arms and legs to swivel round.
done well, the doll really does dance.
bevington is an area of liverpool (england) a formerly thickly wooded area
bewtween bevington hill and everton hill which at one time had a pub called
""the bush"" the pavy is the pavilion theatre in new brighton, again an area
of liverpool.
the version of the song i know goes:-
he sat on the corner of bevington bush
astride of an old packing case
and the dolls at the end of his plank went dancing
as he crooned with a smile of his face.
come day go day
wish in my heart for sunday
drinking buttermilk all the week
whisky on  a sunday
his tired old hands drummed a wooden beam
and the puppets dolls they danced the gear
a  far better show than you ever did see
at the pavy on new brighton pier
in 1905 old seth davy died,
his songs were heard no more
the three dancing dolls
in a jowler bin ended
and the plank went to mend
some back door
but on some stormy nights
down scotty road way
when the wind whistles up from the sea
you can still hear the sound of old seth davy
as he croons to his dancing dolls three
the version you perform seems to have eminated from the irish rovers who
may have altered the song to fit a dublin location, beggars bush being a part of dublin.
hope this is of interest to you. if you log onto www.mudcat.org you will
find a thread i put on. it is quite an interesting site for finding lyrics
if you can cut your way through the tedious correspondence.
finally a jowler bin is simply a refuse bin, normally located in the
alleys at the back of the house. two other site you may find of interest are
www.cromarty.freeserve.co.uk which has lyrics and www.louisville.edu which
has liverpool slang

"Who Threw The Overalls in Mrs, Murphy's Chowder?",https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=384,"who threw the overalls in mrs, murphy's chowder?
nobody spoke so they shouted all the louder
it's an irish trick that's true
i can lick the mick that threw
the overalls in mrs. murphy's chowder
mrs. murphy gave a party 'bout a week ago
everything was plentiful the murphys they're not slow
they treated us like gentlemen we tried to act the same
except for what had happened well it was an awful shame
when mrs. murphy dished the chowder out she fainted on the spot
she found a pair of overalls at the bottom of the pot
tim nolan he got hoppin' mad his eyes were bulging out
he jumped up om the piano and began to scream and shout  
well they fished the pants from out the soup and laid them on the floor
every man swore up and down he's ne'er seen them before
they were plastered up with  morter and worn out at the knees
they had their manys ups and downs as we could plainly see
when mrs. murphy she ""came to"" she began to cry and pout
she had them in the wash that day and forgot to take them out
tim nolan had apologised for what he said that night
so we put the words to music and we sang with all our might  oh ! "
Why do you have to get Drunk...,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=385,"why do you have to get drunk to be an asshole?
why do you have to get tight before you get loose
why do you need a double before you get into trouble
can't you get into trouble without an excuse?
you want to get up and get out and get free and get crazy
but why do you have to start by getting stoned
no, you don't have to get drunk to be an asshole
you can be an asshole on your own
why do you need a dozen pinacoladas
before you show the world your brand new dance
why do you need a snootfull to start acting silly and youthful
do you think the girls all think it's cute when you piss in your pants
so then next time you need the courage to say, ""hello babe!""
does a marquerita really help?
you don't have to get dunk to be an asshole, you can be an asshole by yourself
why do you need a six pack just to get sexy?
why do you need a tequila to put on a dress
why do you need a martini to show the world your weenie
don't you know your weenies more when you're martini less
you can embarrass yourself without getting a load on
so you can stay sober and still throw up on your date
you don't have to get drunk to be an asshole, you can be an asshole being straight
why do you need a bottle of wine to be tender,
why do you need a gimlet just to get rude
why do you need champagne to go screw out your brain?
wouldn't you like to know who the hell it was you screwed?
so the next time you want to get naked and climb up a flagpole
or holler, ""i can whip any man in the bar!""
remember you don't have to get drunk to be an asshole,
you can be an asshole like you are."
Why Paddy's Not at Work Today,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=386,"dear sir i write this note to inform you of my plight
and at the time of writing i am not a pretty sight
my body is all black and blue, my face a deathly gray
i write this note to tell why paddy's not at work today
while working on the fourteenth floor, some bricks i had to clear
and to throw them down from off the top seemed quite a good idea
but the gaffer wasn't very pleased, he was an awful sod
he said i had to cart them down the ladder in me hod.
well clearing all those bricks by hand, it seemed so very slow
so i hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below
but in my haste to do the job, i was too blind to see
that a barrel full of building bricks is heavier than me.
so when i had untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead
and clinging tightly to the rope i started up instead
i took off like a rocket and to my dismay i found
that half way up i met the bloody barrel coming down.
well the barrel broke my shoulder as on to the ground it sped
and when i reached the top i banged the pulley with me head
i held on tight, though numb with shock from this almighty blow
and the barrel spilled out half its load fourteen floors below
now when those building bricks fell from the barrel to the floor
i then outweighed the barrel so i started down once more
i held on tightly to the rope as i flew to the ground
and i landed on those building bricks that were scattered all
around.
now as i lay there on the deck i thought i'd passed the worst
but when the barrel reached the top, that's when the bottom burst
a shower of bricks came down on me, i knew i had no hope
in all of this confusion, i let go the bloody rope.
the barrel being heavier, it started down once more
and landed right on top of me as i lay on the floor
it broke three ribs and my left arm, and i can only say
that i hope you'll understand why paddy's not at work today."
Wild Colonial Boy,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=387,"there was a wild colonial boy, jack duggan was his name
he was born and raised in ireland in a place called castle maine
he was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
and dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy
at the early age of sixteen years, jack left his native home
and to australia's sunny shores he was inclined to roam
he robbed the rich, he helped the poor he shot james mcevoy
a terror to australia wsa, the wild colonial boy
one morning on the prarie, as jack he rode along
and listening to the mosckingbird, sing it's joyful song
up came a band of troopers, kelly, davis and fitzroy
they'd all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy
""surrender now jack duggan for you see we're three to one""
""surrender in the queen's high name for you are a plundering son""
jack drew two pistols from his belt and proudly waved them high
""i'll fight but not surrender!"" said the wild colonial boy
he fired a shot at kelly, which laid him to the groud
and turning 'round to davis he received a fatal wound
a bullet pierced the fierce young heart from the pistol of fitzroy
and that was how they captured him the wild colonial boy"
Wild Rover,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=388,"and it's no nay never (4 claps)

no never no more (2 claps)
i've been the wild rover for manys a year
and i spent all my money on whiskey and beer
and now i'm returning with gold in great score
and i never will play the wild rover no more  
i went into an ale house i used to frequent
and i told the landlady my money was spent
i asked her for credit she answered me nay
such a custom as your i can get any day  
then out of my pockets i took sovereigns bright
and my landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
she said, ""i have whiskey and wines of the best!""
but the answer i gave her was only in jest   
i'll go home to my parents, confess what i've done
and i'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
and if they caress my as oft times before
than i never will play the wild rover no more   "
William Bloat,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=389,"tune:dawning of the day   a.k.a raglan road
in a mean abode on the skankill road
lived a man named william bloat;
he had a wife, the bane of his life,
who always got his goat.
so one day at dawn, with her nightdress on
he slit her bloody throat.
with a razor gash he settled her hash
oh never was crime so quick
but the drip drip drip on the pillowslip '
of her lifeblood made him sick.
and the pool of gore on the bedroom floor
grew clotted and cold and thick.
and yet he was glad he had done what he had
when she lay there stiff and still
but a sudden awe of the angry law
struck his heart with an icy chill.
so to finish the fun so well begun
he decided himself to kill.
so he took the sheet from the wife's cold feet
and twisted it into a rope
and he hanged himself from the pantry shelf,
'twas an easy end, let's hope.
with him facin' death with his dyin' breath
he solemnly cursed the pope.
but the strangest turn to the whole concern
is only just beginning.
he went to hell but his wife got well
and she's still alive and sinning.
for the razor blade was english made
but the bedsheet was irish linen."
Willie McBride a.k.a. Green Fields of France,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=390,"did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly,
did they sound the death march as they lowered you down
did the band play the last post and ,
did the pipes play the ""flowers of the forest""
well how do you do young willie mcbride?
do you mind if i sit down here by your graveside
and rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun
i've been walkin' all day and i'm nearly done
i see by your gravestone you were only nineteen
when you joined the great fallen of 1916
well i hope you died quick and i hope you died clean
willie mcbride was it slow and obscene   
and the beautiful wife or the sweetheart for life
in some faithful heart are you forever enshrined
and although you died back in 1916
in that faithful heart are you forever nineteen?
or are you a stranger without even a name
enshrined forever behind a glass pane
in an ould photograph torn tattered and stained,
fading to yellow in a brown leather frame?   
now the sun shines down on the green fields of france
a warm summer wind makes the red poppys dance
the trences have vanished under the plows,
there's no gas no barbed wire, there's no guns firing now
but here in this graveyard it's still no man's land,
the countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
for man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
to a whole generation that was butchered and damned   
now willie mcbride i can't help wonder why
do those who lie here do they know why they died
did they really beleive when they answered the call
did they really believe that this war would end wars
forever this song of suffereing and shame
the killing the dying was all done in vain
for young willie mcbride it's all happened again,
and again, and again, and again and again"
Wind in the Willows (Bread and Fishes),https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=391,"as i went a walking
one morning in spring
i met with some travelers
in an old country lane
one was an old man
the 2nd a maid
the 3rd was a young boy
who smiled as he said
with the wind in the willows
and the birds in the sky
we've a bright sun to warm us
wherever we lie
we have bread and fishes
and a jug of red wine
to share on our journey
with all of mankind
i sat down beside them
the flowers all around
and we ate on a mantel
spread out on the ground
they told me of prophets
and princes and kings
and they spoke of the one god
who knows everything  
i asked them to tell me
their name and their race
so i might remember
their kindness and grace
my name is joseph
this is mary my wife
and this is our young son
our pride and delight  
we traveled the whole world
by land and by sea
to tell all the people
how they might be free  "
Wind That Shakes the Barley,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=392,"i sat within a valley green sat there with my true love
and my fond heart strove to choose between the old love and the new love
the old for her, the new that made me think on ireland dearly
while soft the wind blew down the glade and shook the golden barley
'twas hard the mournful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
ah, but harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
and so i said, ""the mountain glen i'll seek at morning early
and join the brave united men"" while soft wind shook the barley
'twas sad i kissed away her tears her arms around me clinging
when to my ears that fateful shot come out the wildwood ringing
the bullet pierced my true love's breast in life's young spring so early
and there upon my breast she died while soft wind shook the barley
i bore her to some mountain stream and many's the summer blossom
i placed with branches soft and green about her gore-stained bosom
i wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse then rushed o'er vale and valley
my vengeance on the foe to wreak while soft wind shook the barley
twas blood for blood without remorse i took at oulart hollow
i placed my true love's clay-cold corpse where mine full soon may follow
around her grave i wondered drear noon, night and morning early
with aching heart when e'er i hear the wind that shakes the barley"
Wind That Shakes the Corn,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=393,"i sat within the valley green i sat with my true love

while soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden corn
t'was hard the woeful words to bring to break the ties that bound
but harder still to bear the shame of english chains around
and so i said, the mountain glen i'll seek in early morn
and join the brave united men while soft winds shook the corn
while sad i kissed away her tears my fond arms round her clung
a british shot burst in our ears from out of the wild woods round
one bullet pierced my true love's side a rose pierced by a thorn
and in my arms in blood she died while soft winds shook the corn
so blood for blood without remorse i've taken in the glen
i placed my true love's clayful corpse i joined true irish men
but around her grave i wander drear sometimes in early morn
and with breaking heart sometimes i hear the wind that shakes the corn"
Winds of Morning,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=477,"i've walked the hills when rain was falling
rested by a wide oak tree
heard a lark sing high at evening
caught a moonbeam on the sea
softly blow ye winds of morning
sing ye winds your mournful sound
blow ye from the earth's four corners
guide this traveller where he's bound
i've helped a ploughman tend his horses
heard a rippling river sing
talked to stars when night was falling
seen a primrose welcome spring
by foreign shores, my feet have wandered
heard a stranger call me friend
every time my mind was troubled
found a smile around the bend
there's a ship stands in the harbour
all prepared to cross the foam
far off hills were fair and friendly
still there's fairer hills at home"

of empty days and lonely nights
to cry yourself to sleep, next day you try again
i used to think this is the way that is would always be
then you turned my world around and gave your life to me  
and now i find such peace of mind
a smile to warm my day like sunshine after rain
reach our your hand, lead me along
the happiness you bring, i may never know again

Zebra Roses,https://www.irishsongs.com/lyrics.php?Action=view&Song_id=588,"my zebra roses are purple and pink
sometimes when they close
they give me a wink
yes they give me a wink
but they don't often close
they enjoy being part of my garden rainbow
my zebra roses are covered with stripes
but the colors they show are not just black and white
my zebra roses show all of the colors
they are like no others they bloom day and night
my zebra roses are blue and they're green
when the sun falls upon them they twinkle and sheen
the pretty stripes and colors you've seen
in the light of the moon they reflect the moonbeams
my zebra roses are red and they're yellow
the colors are soft and lazy and mellow
they turn up a smile from the grumpiest fellow
oh i wish i could make this garden my pillow
my zebra roses are friends to the bees
i watch him take nectar but he'll never sneeze
and if he he does the louder he'll buzz
it's the prettiest garden.. ever there ever was"
